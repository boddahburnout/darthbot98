25 Aug 2017 22:57:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Oh shit *consults wikipedia*
25 Aug 2017 22:57:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Category 4 - Catastrophic damage will occur
25 Aug 2017 22:57:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, WELL
25 Aug 2017 22:57:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that is seriously not good
25 Aug 2017 22:57:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Category 4 hurricanes tend to produce more extensive curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common.
25 Aug 2017 22:57:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.
25 Aug 2017 22:58:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I hope you hoarded batteries, Light
25 Aug 2017 22:58:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, jesus that is terrifying

25 Aug 2017 22:58:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I spawned where I logged out my island but I still can't get back to spawn
25 Aug 2017 22:58:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, You can't do /spawn?
25 Aug 2017 22:59:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, same error message "could not get the world, unable to spawn"
25 Aug 2017 22:59:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ah shit, I just sudo'd in console and got a debug message
25 Aug 2017 23:00:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Multi world is apparently linked to allow-nether in the server.propeties file, which is a bit weird

25 Aug 2017 23:17:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, The way it should work is, you spawn at spawn initially, can /spawn to go back there, and when you log out somewhere, you log back in to that same position
25 Aug 2017 23:21:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, oh new solution for banned items https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/mmcrestrict-a-simple-item-restriction-plugin/18437

25 Aug 2017 23:32:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's separate audio and mic ports
25 Aug 2017 23:32:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that is kinda weird
25 Aug 2017 23:33:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ^
25 Aug 2017 23:34:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, How is it weird?
25 Aug 2017 23:34:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's standard for it to be 2 separate ports, it's just weird computers which have it as 1 port
25 Aug 2017 23:34:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, dunno I am just used to 2 in 1 ports I suppose

26 Aug 2017 03:02:50 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, second level of adminshop, its currently closed
26 Aug 2017 03:02:58 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Though I found my spider spawner
26 Aug 2017 03:03:16 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, theres no silk spawnes
26 Aug 2017 03:03:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, before you go trying
26 Aug 2017 03:03:39 : Legacy Craft, general, silverstrom#2671, is it purchase spawners only or does it include ones you find
26 Aug 2017 03:04:11 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, i think just in general
26 Aug 2017 03:04:20 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, 4 per person in general
26 Aug 2017 03:04:34 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, so there could be a 8 or + spawner room but only if 2 people own the spawner room
26 Aug 2017 03:04:40 : PokeIslands, news, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @‚Äãeveryone my host as replied!
26 Aug 2017 03:04:41 : PokeIslands, news, KiritoSanPlays#2208, The files are not accessible during this time.

We can offer you a new service right now, but that would mean losing all files on the old service. If you're okay with that, please state so and we will proceed with getting you a service and compensating you for the downtime.

Thank you for choosing GGServers.

26 Aug 2017 03:06:51 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ_Phatzo#8045, I was going to put a donation option up. For spawners. But the EULA says I can't
26 Aug 2017 03:07:03 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, lol nope
26 Aug 2017 03:07:08 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, doc you need to make a donor warp for creative
26 Aug 2017 03:07:15 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Nope
26 Aug 2017 03:07:15 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ_Phatzo#8045, Yes, yes I do
26 Aug 2017 03:07:22 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, set it for flatcreative world tho
26 Aug 2017 03:07:24 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ_Phatzo#8045, I'll do that after the stream.
26 Aug 2017 03:07:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, not creative creative

26 Aug 2017 03:08:07 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, and you can't either, since im not talking, im typing

26 Aug 2017 03:09:03 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Well tbh if people are going to be paying for perks in the game than why not have a terrain creative world instead of a flat world? Give players what they are paying for.
26 Aug 2017 03:09:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, they are paying for "creative world" nothing saying the certain type
26 Aug 2017 03:09:48 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, so they are paying for the permission to enter the creative world :< not specific on what kind
26 Aug 2017 03:11:12 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, And the term shut up can also be used to tell you to stop typing as many people have probably told tone death people to shut up when they were hand signing their words or typing it into a voice bot that spoke out the words they couldn't say due to their vocal disability.
26 Aug 2017 03:11:36 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, mhmm
26 Aug 2017 03:11:41 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, So again shut up dormant!
26 Aug 2017 03:11:43 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, Though still, you have no power over me and what i say, so there is no reason i should listen to such things as you command.

I want to thank everyone who has made LegacyCraft what it is today. What started off as a pipe dream, has grown into a community. I've never wanted to be a top 5 server, all I've ever wanted was a community. you all have made that a reality. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for us. Next week we will be holding a scavenger hunt, on a map that contains the best of 1.8, 1.9.4, 1.11.2, and 1.12. Old structures current structures, and some you've never seen before üòâ The winner of this scavenger hunt, will recieve one **Legacy Key**

I have no words, Thank you, Thank you, **THANK YOU** for making us what we are today

#Long Live Legacy

26 Aug 2017 16:45:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, Ozicarus#8421, Point being though - and this was discussed a lot when we started last year - most of the time people don't abuse it, so we tended to trust them to use it responsibly

26 Aug 2017 22:35:49 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, jjtwilefc#7374, Isn't it like big black women?
26 Aug 2017 22:35:54 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, jjtwilefc#7374, Or somethin
26 Aug 2017 22:35:58 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, shuck#1142, bbw stands for "big beautiful women." these are woman who are overweight and still feel deserving of love because they realize that they don't have to live up to certain "standards" that society has set in order to be pretty. this obviously takes self-esteem and courage, and it's a landmark to get past. an overweight woman who still feels beautiful is very admirable
26 Aug 2017 22:36:08 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, shuck#1142, some of the stereotypes that have been written before mine are ridiculous. it seems like half the people on this website think anyone who is overweight sits around all day, never gets off their ass, and only moves when they want to go from the couch to the fridge. this is so far from the truth, and i feel the need to set the record straight. most overweight woman... AND men... are normal people walking around living their lives just like anyone else. i'm sure many would be surprised to see the eating habits of an overweight person. it isn't necessarily a person who sits around eating McDonalds all day, so you best get that out of your head.

26 Aug 2017 22:36:19 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, shuck#1142, anyone who is still reading is probably smirking in their seat, muttering "yeah okay fattie." and it is true, i'm overweight, though i am not disgusting.
