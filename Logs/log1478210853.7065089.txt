03 Nov 2016 22:18:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I accidentally posted an extensive, negative review of the gynecologist I visited earlier this week. I messed up and posted it from my work's customer service email, so now it looks like the large, well-known company I work for had a poor gynecological experience. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:18:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I was at a party and saw an old friend from college. I went up to her asking how she was and how her family was. She went on to tell me that her husband left her a month ago and started crying. I  told her that he was an ass anyway and that she didn't need him. Turns out he died. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:20:56 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I found out that if a jock calls you a nerd in the street and you retaliate with a witty comeback, be prepared to run. Fast. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:21:12 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I had to take my 15-year-old son to the hospital. He'd gone out dressed as some My Little Pony character and encountered someone who'd had the same idea. They then got into a fistfight, and my son got the shit beaten out of him. I wish I'd never bred. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:21:12 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, while working as a parking booth attendant I decided to be nice and offer a woman free parking. I said, "give me a high five and I'll give you free parking since I already did the paper work." She said, "I'd rather pay," with a really disgusted look. I also had to redo the paper work. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:22:11 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, my friends and I go to a bar and get wasted. I walk around and see a kid. I start yelling, "There's a child in this bar! There's a CHILD in this BAR!" She turns around. She was a midget. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:22:11 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I woke up after a night out drinking on my sofa, with an electric dog collar around my neck and handcuffs on my wrists. The keys were on the other side of the invisible doggy fence. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:22:58 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I took my girlfriend out to a nice restaurant for our anniversary. Mid-way through the meal, a guy at the table across left for the restroom. My girlfriend reached over and swiped the guy's wallet from the table. My gonads went AWOL, and I couldn't even bring myself to call her out on it. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:22:59 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I woke up with pink eye. My mom tried to help by putting drops in. It started burning like hell; she didn't understand why. It turns out she was putting ear drops in my eye. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:23:57 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I had lunch with a co-worker, and after having a good talk and enjoying each others company, we got up to leave. Right before we said goodbye, she looked me right in the face and looking legitimately confused said "you know, I really don't understand why no one at work likes you." FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:23:58 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I downloaded the 'Dark was the Night' compilation made for charity. I have no soul. FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:24:31 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I got fired from my part-time job, because I insisted on keeping my phone in my pocket and never using it, instead of putting it in locker without a lock or security camera, that anyone can go through. The manager found out by searching my locker for the past 3 weeks. Ironic. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:24:31 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I now accept how stupid I was to marry a man whose plans for the future all start with "When I win the lottery..." FML*

03 Nov 2016 22:25:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, I met a really nice couple at a bar. We talked and the conversation eventually drifted towards online dating. I casually commented that hooking up through the internet was sad and pathetic. Turns out they met on Myspace. FML*
03 Nov 2016 22:25:42 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Today, as I was stretching, I realized my hand can reach all the way up to touch the fan, when it was on, and going full speed. FML*
