22 Apr 2017 00:55:52 : RooberBoobers, kinkyroleplay, ComradeBismuth#5997, She felt a pang of guilt, seeing the Opals so enamoured with her fat. Still, she thought, maybe that'd make it easier to eat them.
22 Apr 2017 00:56:10 : RooberBoobers, kinkyroleplay, Tic-Tat-Purl#4152, "aww, I think they like you!"

22 Apr 2017 00:59:29 : RooberBoobers, kinkyroleplay, ComradeBismuth#5997, Gusty grabbed them back. "Nope nope you said you were giving them away"
22 Apr 2017 00:59:52 : RooberBoobers, kinkyroleplay, Collin#5120, Mmphie really wanted to tie up Gutsy. But in a painful fashion, one that would help her keep the larger Ruby in check.
