18 Sep 2017 23:20:39 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 1. Similar to a ragequit, when someone quits an online match in a fighting game or first-person shooter out of fury of losing, with the primary difference being in having a relatively relaxed disposition upon quitting. Calmquitting can be caused by things other than a lack of skill, such as a busy schedule or simple apathy. 
2. A ragequit where the ragequitter was not audibly or visually angered to the point where you wonder if the online connection was simply disconnected.
I could've won, but I realized I was gonna be late to work, so I had to calmquit.

We will be opening the map in sections and only one section (a "section" can be defined as a route/town/cave/forest) will be opened at a time. Beta poeple get to explore the sections before other people!

Also, the modpack will be updated later today.
