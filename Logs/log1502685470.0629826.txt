14 Aug 2017 06:48:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, Since we have agreed to a custom modpack and we don't have any protection as of yet, how about a grief proof-factions server for protection? As you mentioned in the olden days of factions limitless, raiding was not possible since you cannot take over other factions claims and explosions were turned off. However, enemying and fighting was was still possible, which I think would be really cool with all these mods in place. Also, give players the option to play completely peaceful. I have not seen any other servers with FTB and factions so I think it would be pretty unique and attract more players.
