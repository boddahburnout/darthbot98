14 Oct 2016 06:00:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Young mom#1962, Does that mean that Voter ranks will come back?
14 Oct 2016 06:24:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, Ill start promoting pretty hardcore then. I had a few ideas on that I wanted to run by you @Jay113355 at some point. Just for an idea of what I can promote about the server; what are you able to say at the moment in regards to what the future holds and what kind of content we could see with our server? Return of item store? You already said voting (just for how I write why was  it taken out in the first place?) Could we see a border expansion or a reset of shrines/natural structures with an influx of new players? As for the genre of the server (so to speak) should I tought us as family friendly or adult oriented? (I prefer adult oriented because I like swearing and making crude jokes with @Harambe ) and finally what havent I asked that wouod be a good descriptive term for the server
14 Oct 2016 06:27:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, The border is at its max as of a few weeks ago
14 Oct 2016 06:27:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, Also dont advertise on servers or anything
14 Oct 2016 06:27:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, doing that type of thing harms us more then it helps
14 Oct 2016 06:28:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, What? Why im the world would I? Come on now, I dont come off as an asshole who advertises on servers do I? Lol. Nah I am apart of a few gaming communities with forums and message boards, as well as sub reddits.
14 Oct 2016 06:30:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, I'm starting to lean the server more a family friendly way
14 Oct 2016 06:30:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, more teen anyway
14 Oct 2016 06:32:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, Is swearing going to be out soon then :'( ah well. Ok that helps me then. Give me until the end of the day and ill have a short little piece written up that we can use to recruit.
14 Oct 2016 06:34:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, hmm :3

Q2. Postgres connection
answer is **21** for that part
14 Oct 2016 07:03:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, We did really well back when we had voting
14 Oct 2016 07:03:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, it should be enough
14 Oct 2016 07:04:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, its a bit late in the month to get started but
14 Oct 2016 07:04:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, hey
14 Oct 2016 07:10:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, only 14 days into october lol
14 Oct 2016 07:11:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, Every little bit helps. Plus you have to remember that progress, not stagnation, is good. If we as a server never change and continue to remove stuff people want, people are inevenitably going to leave. There are probably 10 people that were here back in May. Least regularly. Thats not a lot. We should always look to be improving while still keeping the integrity youve worked so hard for.
14 Oct 2016 07:12:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, People come to integrity alone, but people stay for progress.
