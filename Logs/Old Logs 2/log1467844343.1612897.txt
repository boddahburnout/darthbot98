06 Jul 2016 22:58:02 : LimitlessMc , AnishaLunarAngel#5926 , depthy. the issue is that fornor gave away EVERYTHING because he was "quitting" Palkia wanted a shiny absol more than anything, and fornor was going to give it to him and then said he changed his mind and threw it away, which really upset Palkia and me. then a minute later he showed me that he gave it to palkia to calm me down cuz I was really pissed off. I got even more angry cuz I basically made a fool of myself for no reason. and now he comes back and changed his mind about leaving and asks for the absol back. which Palkia did do, but what the fuck? some friend you are fornor..  .-.
