All was going well, and then before our first song I threw the sticks in the air, went to catch them, and one hit me right in the eye. I couldn't continue playing. Now I have to wear an eyepatch.

We walked by a Wax Museum and in front of the museum there was a bench with a very realistic wax man sitting on it.
