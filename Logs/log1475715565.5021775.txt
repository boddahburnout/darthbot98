06 Oct 2016 05:35:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, @Staff got a quick issue. The player Eyreya is a good friend of mine. He plays on the server and was on before the reset couple months ago. This past week he logged in and noticed a couple of his pokemon are breeding locked in the computer... Even though none of them are in ranch blocks. He thinks they were in a ranch block before the reset though. He and I (since one of the locked ones is my bad ass ditto) was wondering if theres anything that can be done about it.
06 Oct 2016 05:37:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, you can stop @ staff because they hate you

06 Oct 2016 05:46:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, No he doesnt. Jay is aggravatingly the least corrupt owner I know. Usually if I offer someone 100£ to give me 4 unbreaking tools, they give it to me.
