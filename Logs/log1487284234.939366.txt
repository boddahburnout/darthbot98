17 Feb 2017 22:11:41 : The Wild Weebs, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ```1.
(1756050 * 21369779 * 7060525) / (50220423)^2 equals about 105054

2.
(1,060,222 * 646,599 * 4,000,829) / (50220423)^2 equals about 1087

3.
120 / 4000 * 1756050 = about 52681

4.
144,300 / 30% * 1756050 * 1756050 = 481000
The 4th method gave the most accurate estimation.```

18 Feb 2017 03:16:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, VividerConch105#9448, What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Gifted, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the mathletes, and I have over 300 confirmed hacks. I am trained in nerd warfare and I’m the top mathmatician in the entire US. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can hack you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my feet. Not only am I extensively trained in binary combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the public library and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

**Tgamer101** somehow managed to vote 5 times in quick succession, Not sure if it was bug or not, but he got 2 masterballs from it. Here's some screenshots I took of the votes. Not sure if he's taking advantage of some sort of glitch or not, but it's pretty odd.

My soul is tormented by a succubus
Call her sis, pantsu drippin from the way I spit
Fell in love with this, siscon music now she in my grips
Wanna take a sip, of her onii-sans essence
No-no-no questions asked, always let onii smash
Trying up my siscon team, get a foot off in your ass, boooy
I ain't talkin' bout that DOA
But shawtys jiggle physics on the level of Ayane mane
Okay okay, we actin out them eroges
Shout out to tama for them tags they soundin sexy
Tell your nii chan come and test me if that nigga wants some beef
In the sheets and ecchi guy, but in the streets I be the (senpai)
Chillin watching hentai with other niggas kouhais
Like her skirts mini sized and socks pulled up knee high
"A" cup is just fine with onii (shh) close your eyes
Promise you will love it, just relax tonight with (senpai)

19 Feb 2017 08:51:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony#6564, is that votes get reset when map resets
19 Feb 2017 08:51:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony#6564, so you'd never get the prize
19 Feb 2017 08:51:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, and we don't need to reset for multiple years
