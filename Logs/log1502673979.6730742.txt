14 Aug 2017 04:08:13 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Yeah, it has to restart for that to fix itself
14 Aug 2017 04:08:20 : PokeIslands, general, Ram#1721, like random starters, pokemon in diffrent spots like pikachu in the snow place for ex
14 Aug 2017 04:08:36 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, also there is a delay for some reason a long delay for responding
14 Aug 2017 04:08:47 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, Ram do you have spawn of psyduck?
14 Aug 2017 04:08:56 : Achievement Heaven, ah-general, GamerKatland#1817, I have news @maddog780ca  and @HappyDogLizardMan  had a baby named @llchubyll

14 Aug 2017 04:22:16 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Music can detect when the queue of songs broke
14 Aug 2017 04:22:24 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, But if a song crashes it can't autofix
14 Aug 2017 04:22:35 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol would be hard to code 2
14 Aug 2017 04:22:52 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, But I can prob add a few more tests and have it auto restart if it detects no song being played and songs in queue

14 Aug 2017 04:23:59 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like the ;level one or so
14 Aug 2017 04:24:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but wouldn't that break the command for everyone?
14 Aug 2017 04:24:56 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Why need anti-spam for lv cmd?
14 Aug 2017 04:25:09 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, was just an example lol
14 Aug 2017 04:25:50 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Oh xD thought you had commands that people spammed
14 Aug 2017 04:26:02 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, or what about making it so that certain commands can only be used in certain channels?
14 Aug 2017 04:26:10 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I was going to make that
14 Aug 2017 04:26:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, oh lol
14 Aug 2017 04:26:17 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Was going to be my next major change
14 Aug 2017 04:26:45 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, A ;deactivate command
14 Aug 2017 04:27:08 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i just wonder how the bot notices which channel to ignore what command and so on if you know what i mean
14 Aug 2017 04:27:14 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, So you could be like `;deactivate level`
14 Aug 2017 04:27:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, nah that would be stupid xD
14 Aug 2017 04:27:55 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well not stupid but xD
