14 Aug 2017 04:22:16 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Music can detect when the queue of songs broke

14 Aug 2017 04:22:35 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol would be hard to code 2

14 Aug 2017 04:23:59 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like the ;level one or so
14 Aug 2017 04:24:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but wouldn't that break the command for everyone?
14 Aug 2017 04:24:56 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Why need anti-spam for lv cmd?

14 Aug 2017 04:25:50 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Oh xD thought you had commands that people spammed
14 Aug 2017 04:26:02 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, or what about making it so that certain commands can only be used in certain channels?
14 Aug 2017 04:26:10 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I was going to make that
14 Aug 2017 04:26:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, oh lol
14 Aug 2017 04:26:17 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Was going to be my next major change
14 Aug 2017 04:26:45 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, A ;deactivate command
14 Aug 2017 04:27:08 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i just wonder how the bot notices which channel to ignore what command and so on if you know what i mean
14 Aug 2017 04:27:14 : PokeIslands, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, So you could be like `;deactivate level`
14 Aug 2017 04:27:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, nah that would be stupid xD
14 Aug 2017 04:27:55 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well not stupid but xD
