08 Aug 2017 23:21:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, it isn't an option for me

08 Aug 2017 23:21:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, OH

08 Aug 2017 23:22:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, who's the discord owner? XD
08 Aug 2017 23:22:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Right click a username
08 Aug 2017 23:22:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It might be that you can't, as it's an admin rank
08 Aug 2017 23:22:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, hmmmm
08 Aug 2017 23:22:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, well that is odd
08 Aug 2017 23:22:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i'm guessing oz is the discord owner?
08 Aug 2017 23:22:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Would make sense though
08 Aug 2017 23:22:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yer
08 Aug 2017 23:22:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, then you can do it
08 Aug 2017 23:22:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I know I can
08 Aug 2017 23:22:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean I probs wont ever need to
08 Aug 2017 23:22:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, no admin perm needed
08 Aug 2017 23:22:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, just weird
08 Aug 2017 23:23:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, it's your highest rank mike
08 Aug 2017 23:23:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lol oz you can literally never leave
08 Aug 2017 23:23:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, if I ever go you still need to be here
08 Aug 2017 23:23:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Meh, i'll be semi active for a bit longer
08 Aug 2017 23:23:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, you can't promote people to the rank your in without admin perms checked
08 Aug 2017 23:23:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, That's how it works with pex too - can't go higher than you
08 Aug 2017 23:23:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, not planning on going though
08 Aug 2017 23:23:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yep
08 Aug 2017 23:23:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, except pex
08 Aug 2017 23:23:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, is annoying
08 Aug 2017 23:23:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, You need the perm too though so
08 Aug 2017 23:23:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, that's why i had the console xD
08 Aug 2017 23:24:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, didn't need pex
08 Aug 2017 23:24:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, pex is kinda a pain but I like it
08 Aug 2017 23:24:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Pex is bae
08 Aug 2017 23:24:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, pex is better than the alternative
08 Aug 2017 23:24:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Once you learn the commands it's easy and powerful
08 Aug 2017 23:24:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, scoreboard is shite
08 Aug 2017 23:24:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I prefer pex commands to fucking with the config
08 Aug 2017 23:24:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, GroupManager is awful
08 Aug 2017 23:24:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, ^^^^^^
08 Aug 2017 23:24:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, w8 why did you wanna know how to promote people mike o.O
08 Aug 2017 23:24:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, am scare

08 Aug 2017 23:25:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, No?
08 Aug 2017 23:25:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Oh
08 Aug 2017 23:25:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Wait
08 Aug 2017 23:25:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, The uhh ban thing?
08 Aug 2017 23:25:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, just curios as I couldn't see it light
08 Aug 2017 23:25:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, yeah oz
08 Aug 2017 23:25:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Woo
08 Aug 2017 23:25:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Well
08 Aug 2017 23:25:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I took a look
08 Aug 2017 23:25:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, legit scare atm
08 Aug 2017 23:25:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that jj could ban me etc
08 Aug 2017 23:25:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And then after 5 minutes of my HARDEST work
08 Aug 2017 23:25:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I decided it wasn't worth fixing
08 Aug 2017 23:25:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lol ffs
08 Aug 2017 23:25:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Just don't ban eachother, it's a very easy fix
08 Aug 2017 23:25:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, jj shouldn't be able to ban you
08 Aug 2017 23:25:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean if that is a mod perm....
08 Aug 2017 23:26:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, kinda don't want that
08 Aug 2017 23:26:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Something something the builder rank messed up the rank ladder but it's ok
08 Aug 2017 23:26:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I think it is a builder thing though
08 Aug 2017 23:26:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, oh my
08 Aug 2017 23:26:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Just don't tell anyone
08 Aug 2017 23:26:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, urgh darn builder rank
08 Aug 2017 23:26:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, may be worth just removing that soon
08 Aug 2017 23:26:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If people start abusing it I can fix it
08 Aug 2017 23:26:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I just couldn't be arsed
08 Aug 2017 23:26:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i had something similar to builder once
08 Aug 2017 23:26:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean we only really had it as I was away
08 Aug 2017 23:27:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but we just took the gmc perms and left it admin only
08 Aug 2017 23:27:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so we should probs just remove it when I am back
08 Aug 2017 23:27:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Sure, that works too
08 Aug 2017 23:27:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, well the builder perms are literally only given to jj
08 Aug 2017 23:27:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, people get power hungry
08 Aug 2017 23:27:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, #shuck
08 Aug 2017 23:27:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, lmao
08 Aug 2017 23:27:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @ProtonBot Will shuck abuse his power?
08 Aug 2017 23:28:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, because he is helping me build a thing and I didn't want him bothering oz or mac to gm c him all the time
08 Aug 2017 23:28:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Botfuzzy77#2209, Why are you sorry?
08 Aug 2017 23:28:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, @ProtonBot  why are you a broken piece of shit?
08 Aug 2017 23:28:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Botfuzzy77#2209, I used to wonder what friendship could be...
08 Aug 2017 23:28:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, NO

08 Aug 2017 23:29:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, 
08 Aug 2017 23:29:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I got a lot better after playing on here

08 Aug 2017 23:30:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, plsno xD
08 Aug 2017 23:30:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, if @royalsfan10 is sorting out our social media
08 Aug 2017 23:30:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i just like to code stuff üòõ
08 Aug 2017 23:30:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Why do we need social media?
08 Aug 2017 23:30:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, facebook
08 Aug 2017 23:30:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, hahaha well I have given you a coding projectt üòõ
08 Aug 2017 23:30:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We can barely call ourselves a network
08 Aug 2017 23:30:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, the way of the future
08 Aug 2017 23:31:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, just another way to keep people up to date with things we are doing
08 Aug 2017 23:31:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, and to showcase cool stuff people build
08 Aug 2017 23:31:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, how many people do we average daily?
08 Aug 2017 23:31:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We have a website
08 Aug 2017 23:31:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Like 10+
08 Aug 2017 23:31:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i c
08 Aug 2017 23:31:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I want people to use the website more, it's dead
08 Aug 2017 23:31:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, we need clickbait
08 Aug 2017 23:31:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We have 180ish members and none of them post
08 Aug 2017 23:31:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, like no one uses the forum other than to apply for staff and to store stuff
08 Aug 2017 23:32:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Maybe we should give people $500 for posting
08 Aug 2017 23:32:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Or something
08 Aug 2017 23:32:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean that is just silly.....
08 Aug 2017 23:32:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, then it'd become a spam fest
08 Aug 2017 23:32:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, $1000 one time when you sign up and make an introduction thread
08 Aug 2017 23:32:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I've seen that done before, worked well
08 Aug 2017 23:32:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, then it would just be full of introduction threads
08 Aug 2017 23:32:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, and staff apps
08 Aug 2017 23:32:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Which would then lead to more conversations!
08 Aug 2017 23:32:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Or at least make it somewhat more active/varied
08 Aug 2017 23:33:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, not convinced....
08 Aug 2017 23:33:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, [Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ(Ã≤ÃÖ5Ã≤ÃÖ)Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ]
08 Aug 2017 23:33:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I think there needs to be a reason for people to use it
08 Aug 2017 23:33:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, [Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ(Ã≤ÃÖ1000)Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ]

08 Aug 2017 23:33:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, failfish
08 Aug 2017 23:33:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, and post on it
08 Aug 2017 23:33:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's called being fucking social
08 Aug 2017 23:33:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, mine turned into nothing but staff apps and ban appeals
08 Aug 2017 23:33:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We don't get many ban appeals
08 Aug 2017 23:33:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lol your asking to gamers to be social
08 Aug 2017 23:33:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, then hate comments when people got denied
08 Aug 2017 23:33:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, OTHER FORUMS HAVE POSTS!
08 Aug 2017 23:34:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, mike

08 Aug 2017 23:42:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, goodie!
08 Aug 2017 23:43:02 : Proton Gaming Network, vip, Ozicarus#8421, It's just the trusted rank
08 Aug 2017 23:43:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, 20$ for diamond is amazing
08 Aug 2017 23:43:09 : Proton Gaming Network, vip, Ozicarus#8421, It's for peasants, but premium peasants
08 Aug 2017 23:43:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, the perks are also great
08 Aug 2017 23:43:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but WHAT
08 Aug 2017 23:43:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, if we go one step above that?
08 Aug 2017 23:43:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We don't have very high playership
08 Aug 2017 23:43:46 : Proton Gaming Network, vip, madmike99222#6535, I think it is for doners too oz, please don't call people peasents....
08 Aug 2017 23:43:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah that's the downside
08 Aug 2017 23:43:57 : Proton Gaming Network, vip, Ozicarus#8421, *Premium*
08 Aug 2017 23:44:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, we must grasp the people
08 Aug 2017 23:44:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, well what would we add
08 Aug 2017 23:44:10 : Proton Gaming Network, vip, madmike99222#6535, for fuck sake
08 Aug 2017 23:44:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, having access to /back by purchasing something is a little odd but cool
08 Aug 2017 23:44:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because /back is very popular
08 Aug 2017 23:45:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, it is indeed
08 Aug 2017 23:45:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, it is just useful early game
08 Aug 2017 23:45:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and fly is a staff command
08 Aug 2017 23:45:29 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, so @Bakafish tell us all about light
08 Aug 2017 23:45:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We did consider that when we started it all
08 Aug 2017 23:45:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But as it's a PvP server (technically) it was seen as too big an advantage
08 Aug 2017 23:45:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, fly is kinda pointless in IE
08 Aug 2017 23:45:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah
08 Aug 2017 23:46:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, there are many ways to fly
08 Aug 2017 23:46:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, easily
08 Aug 2017 23:46:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, an advantage in pvp is evil especially being able to fly
08 Aug 2017 23:46:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, well we have some really cool dev making us a super awesome pvp plugin that will solve all the pvp issues
08 Aug 2017 23:46:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Also we don't really have any funding goals
08 Aug 2017 23:46:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So
08 Aug 2017 23:47:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean what would they be
08 Aug 2017 23:47:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, hopefully what i've sent to oz can help
08 Aug 2017 23:47:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, for now anyway
08 Aug 2017 23:47:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, till i finish this new update to everything
08 Aug 2017 23:47:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Any money we've gotten has just gone to xerox and the web server/domains
08 Aug 2017 23:47:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, oh dear

09 Aug 2017 00:01:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, making it simpler like winblows
09 Aug 2017 00:01:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, it is simple if you know what your doing
09 Aug 2017 00:01:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, true that
09 Aug 2017 00:02:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, even windows can be complicating

09 Aug 2017 00:05:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I didn't realise that baka was still playing on that old server
09 Aug 2017 00:05:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but that's fine for now she's in pieces
09 Aug 2017 00:05:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lol what is up with your bot
09 Aug 2017 00:05:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah baka has been over there
09 Aug 2017 00:05:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i broke it

09 Aug 2017 00:05:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i took his source and made lightbot
09 Aug 2017 00:05:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I see I see
09 Aug 2017 00:05:55 : OblivionEvolved, mainchat, Wtsoner#4231, Mank how you be fgt?
09 Aug 2017 00:06:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, BUT i'm taking what he's done and making it completely different
09 Aug 2017 00:06:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, diffrent how so?
09 Aug 2017 00:06:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, less weeb?
09 Aug 2017 00:06:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, while he's working on a minigame
09 Aug 2017 00:06:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i'm making music work better
09 Aug 2017 00:06:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and other things to long to list
09 Aug 2017 00:06:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that sounds kinda ideal
09 Aug 2017 00:06:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, he uses youtube api
09 Aug 2017 00:07:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, so it's choppy sometimes
09 Aug 2017 00:07:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I may end up using yours if you get it to work as music is sort of the reason I want a bot......
09 Aug 2017 00:07:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, it's super easy to make one
09 Aug 2017 00:07:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but yeah lightbot was originally made for music xD
09 Aug 2017 00:07:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, cause i enjoy my metal while wert doesn't
09 Aug 2017 00:07:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, i'm sure it is easy **for you**
09 Aug 2017 00:08:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, easy for anyone tbh

09 Aug 2017 00:37:31 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, and ill make sure leave my rabbit channel out of chat
09 Aug 2017 00:37:50 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, that is upsetting to hear. I finally get to turn off my soldering iron after a few hours of burning myself, dealing with PCBs, soldering pins, and dealing with flux that ends up everywhere. I just got something to eat, and I haven't even left where I was working. I hop on before I head hope and I hear this after talking to a bot? You may have a job but I bet it doesn't involve breathing in noxious fumes that you know are harming your brain, soldering pins accrding to a hand-drawn guide, and using your brain in order to not drop the hot iron on your legs. You then tell me to watch where I'm talking?
09 Aug 2017 00:38:06 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, I really don't care about your rabbit channel, you can post that as you like.
09 Aug 2017 00:38:12 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, just... maybe let up a bit.

09 Aug 2017 00:38:39 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, all you have to do is say okay
09 Aug 2017 00:38:43 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, you have no clue what condition I'm in to talk and that isn't fair to just mouth off to me because I'm using my brain in the wrong places.
09 Aug 2017 00:39:13 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, you made the big deal because i asked you to take it to bot channel
09 Aug 2017 00:39:38 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, "use your brain" that offends people like me who have mental incapacities.
09 Aug 2017 00:40:03 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, I just can't say okay and take your... your *shit!*
09 Aug 2017 00:40:40 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, I'm a human too, remember? Don't forget that I have vocal cords in my neck and a mouth to speak.
09 Aug 2017 00:40:44 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, ALL I SAID AT FIRST
09 Aug 2017 00:40:48 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, WAS FOR YOU TO MOVE TO BOT
09 Aug 2017 00:40:56 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, was to move it to bot chat
09 Aug 2017 00:41:04 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, then you
09 Aug 2017 00:41:13 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, instead of just saying okay i will
09 Aug 2017 00:41:37 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, started the arguement and i felt like defending myself.. I will accept i should of said it better
09 Aug 2017 00:41:45 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I make mistakes as well
09 Aug 2017 00:41:49 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, Hold up. I didn't disagree about moving it to botchat.
09 Aug 2017 00:42:10 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I was never angry
09 Aug 2017 00:42:19 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I cant just get rid of bots

09 Aug 2017 00:42:50 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, and you mention my rabbit chat being bigger
09 Aug 2017 00:43:07 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, and i asked you to just obey the rules
09 Aug 2017 00:43:17 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, but I never said I wasn't!
09 Aug 2017 00:44:40 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I cannot word out what I mean at times so yes sometimes it can be meaner then meant
09 Aug 2017 00:44:52 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, sigh lets just forget this
09 Aug 2017 00:45:08 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, I'm sorry if I'm not clear, I just thought that people could get what I implied.
09 Aug 2017 00:45:10 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, It wasn't to be mean
09 Aug 2017 00:45:39 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, we chalk this up to missunderstanding on both parts
09 Aug 2017 00:45:44 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, agreed?
09 Aug 2017 00:45:51 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DJ Small#8652, yes.
