In an effort to move away from p2w we have decided that Pokemon will no longer be sold on the donation store.
The free shiny and master balls will still be sold however.

We hope to replace the pokemon with some cool new unlockables, pokediguise, placeable statues, and particle effects soon.
We are also going to be changing some of the gameplay around to make our server more unique.
Please let me/us/the forums know if you have any ideas for new (non p2w)donation options or new ideas for pixelmon gameplay.

Please dont forget to vote to help us earn more players!
