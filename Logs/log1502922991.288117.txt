16 Aug 2017 22:46:54 : OblivionEvolved, server_news, StubbyMuffins#1053, @‚Äãeveryone New ark update
16 Aug 2017 22:46:56 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, still uploading
16 Aug 2017 22:47:10 : OblivionEvolved, server_news, StubbyMuffins#1053, Current Version: v265.1
- Fixed a renderer crash and further increased render thread / Options performance.
v265.0
- Huge perf gains, may vary based on system configuration due to upgrading to the latest Unreal Rendering code. After changing your in game settings, be sure to restart your clients!
- Tameable Titanoboas!
- New Server Option: Force Respawn of Wild Dinos on Server Restart! Enabled by default on official servers, this will force weekly respawns of dinos on all servers to prevent certain dino types (like the Basilo and Spino) from becoming depopulated on long running servers. (?ServerAutoForceRespawnWildDinosInterval=SECONDS). Note in some cases this may not work more than once, we may have solved the case but we're looking into it üòâ .
- New Server Option: Tribe Size and Alliance Size Limits! The new tribe member limit is defaulted to 70 players and the new alliance per tribe limit is defaulted to 10 on official servers (MaxAlliancesPerTribe=# and MaxTribesPerAlliance=# in Game.ini). Note: Values may be off by 1 (looking into it!), so just pick your number and then add 1 to it.
- Platform Saddles are now limited to maximum 40 saddles per tribe. Each platform saddle (with structures) counts as 19 tribe tame slots (?PersonalTamedDinosSaddleStructureCost=19 & ?MaxPersonalTamedDinos=40).
16 Aug 2017 22:47:37 : OblivionEvolved, server_news, StubbyMuffins#1053, - 1/4 sized Ragnarok map update (the "Southwest Update"):
https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/211287-ragnarok-dlc-patchnotes-eta-29th-august/
- Eggs no longer fall through structures during rendering.
- Baby ovis should no longer fall through structures after being born.
- Players can now escape being grappled by any enemy by using tools with blades to "cut" the line.
- Turrets now have a Players Only mode which targets players riding on dinos before targetting the dino.
- Crops can now be fertilized be pressing E on them instead of having to open the inventory.
- Hatching and Gestation progress bars now include countdown timers as well as percentages.
- The structure limit is now properly indicated to the player once the limit is reached.
- Storage boxes now indicate if they are full without having to open them.
- Corrected spelling of Pulminoscorpius.
- Pump action shotgun pellets per shot increased from 10 to 12 (20% damage increase on full hit), initial spread decreased from 10 to 7.5, and max cone size at full range decreased from 100 to 75 degrees.
- Decreased the stun on humans from shocking tranq darts from 5 seconds to 2 seconds.
- Fixed 3 exploits used to get under the world map.
- When structures or tames are deleted due to the PVE timer expiring it is now properly communicated in the tribe log.

There will be NO MORE private beta releases.
From now on, @Mr.E will be releasing the latest beta versions of pixelmon reborn to the public.
These versions will have all the latest features, and more!
Mr. E has been working closely with us who are developing this mod in the past months, and he is excited to share the latest betas with you.
Every once in a while, when we release a "STABLE BETA", when we do, the official modpack will update to that "STABLE BETA".
Use the official modpack, or the latest STABLE BETA release if you want 99.99% stability.(edited)

17 Aug 2017 03:05:55 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, I would like to be demoted to Head Admin
17 Aug 2017 03:06:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, why's that
17 Aug 2017 03:06:10 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Cus its a prettier name

17 Aug 2017 03:06:16 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, :I
17 Aug 2017 03:06:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so you don't want the coowner tag?
17 Aug 2017 03:06:28 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Head Admin sounds more powerful >:D
17 Aug 2017 03:06:39 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, coowner is more powerfull then a shitty head admin
17 Aug 2017 03:06:43 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, nay
17 Aug 2017 03:06:46 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Head Admin

17 Aug 2017 03:07:41 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, coowner has more power then a head admin since a head admin can boss arround and a head adming really cant
