18 Jan 2017 03:26:59 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, Welcome to the Pokemon Battle Sim!
Here you fight together against Pokemon Bosses. There are 4 areas, 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard' and 'Insane'.
To fight a boss, you use the command `;pokebattle`, along with the area you wish to fight in, and a set of moves you will fight the boss with.
An example of this is the following:
`;pokebattle easy ngfse` 
which means you will be fighting the easy boss with battle combo of Normal, Grass, Fire, Steel, and Electric.
You can use any combination of the 10 moves which can be found on ';types'
