14 Aug 2017 12:26:32 : Legacy Craft, screenshots, DormantSolice#5007, the thunder powder you have on it just boosts thunder dmg and exchanges some neutral for thunder
14 Aug 2017 12:26:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, well hopefully I won't be a upset
14 Aug 2017 12:26:40 : Legacy Craft, screenshots, DormantSolice#5007, you probs have either life steal or poison
14 Aug 2017 12:26:45 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, everything should be as it was like before except some buildings might have gone or reset
14 Aug 2017 12:26:49 : Legacy Craft, screenshots, tigertiger02#4338, well theres something that keeps giving them damage
14 Aug 2017 12:26:56 : Legacy Craft, screenshots, DormantSolice#5007, click the compass and hover over the player head and lemme see your stats
14 Aug 2017 12:27:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I also find it funny round this time of the year when a bunch of news stories come out with titles like 'The A-level failure who became a multi-millionaire' to try and reassure the failures
14 Aug 2017 12:27:14 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39235168

14 Aug 2017 12:41:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Actually, thinking about it - they run on Java
14 Aug 2017 12:41:55 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So it's probably pretty easy to crash them
14 Aug 2017 12:42:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Light#6734, so does 90%of the world tbh
