10 Oct 2017 17:58:24 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, I have calmed down now and that's because I figured out a rational way for those bad things to happen. The aftermath of said bad things will be seen eventually. And you will know when it has happened. But, for now I can't say anything more on the matter.
10 Oct 2017 18:00:41 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, кιткαт ĸelly#7820, Ok Lily, I understand

10 Oct 2017 18:08:11 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, This is the only chat I can post this in so I shall. And yes, Kelly I'm copy/pasting from SD.
10 Oct 2017 18:08:12 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, I have something I need to say. The only problem is I can't physically say it. So, instead I'm going to say this:

Let's say there are two pools of water, ponds if you'd like, and they are right next to each other. So close that you can stick on hand and foot in each at the same time. Now, you are going swimming but for whatever reason you can't swim in both. You have to choose one. So, let's take a look at each one. Both look appealing but in their own ways. One is extremely relaxing, just the right temperature, and is over all beautiful. The other is dangerous, adventurous looking, and for whatever reason that one calls out to you. However, even though the second is calling out to you, it's the first that your heart says to choose. Your brain on the otherhand says that if you don't choose the second one you will never get to. Now a problem that they both share is that you are unsure if it's even safe to go into either.

So, what do you do?
10 Oct 2017 18:09:12 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Skiddz#6160, ...
10 Oct 2017 18:09:15 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ashley705#9112, ik what your talking about

10 Oct 2017 18:19:48 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, *ZH0UL*#8320, From what u put it, it seems like the first is safer even tho I say otherwise :3 and what the brain says can be applied to either one since u can't pick both right?
10 Oct 2017 18:19:57 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, *ZH0UL*#8320, If that makes ant sense
10 Oct 2017 18:20:39 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, So your choice is...?

10 Oct 2017 23:10:22 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, which means we have to look at what pokemons could be op and which should be disabled

10 Oct 2017 23:11:31 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, or either be cought and then who ever beats you inherits the legendary making him/her unable to run or flee from trainer battles
10 Oct 2017 23:11:45 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if you get what i mean

10 Oct 2017 23:59:10 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, lemme think how i could do it
10 Oct 2017 23:59:36 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i have been trying alot of ways but if we are gonna use custom npc's due quests and so on i could be able to do it 😉
10 Oct 2017 23:59:58 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like the tourney gives a item to a certain player which cant be gained legit
11 Oct 2017 00:00:25 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the player takes that item to the npc to finish a fake quest and automatically receives the tourney points
11 Oct 2017 00:00:59 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, give me a few mins
11 Oct 2017 00:01:05 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, ima see if i can do this the easy way
11 Oct 2017 00:01:07 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, : ^)
11 Oct 2017 00:01:13 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, easy (but meh) way

11 Oct 2017 00:05:17 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, gimme a sec 😉
11 Oct 2017 00:05:22 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, we are still planning things out rn
11 Oct 2017 00:05:23 : PokeIslands, staff, HD#6975, i had to redo everything cuz didnt realize what you wanted
11 Oct 2017 00:05:47 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but first i have to get this sidemod working or find a way to get what i wanna do
11 Oct 2017 00:06:03 : PokeIslands, staff, HD#6975, ok
11 Oct 2017 00:07:04 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, would tournaments
11 Oct 2017 00:07:09 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, give more than 100 points sometimes
11 Oct 2017 00:07:11 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, or always 100
11 Oct 2017 00:07:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, or is that just a test value
11 Oct 2017 00:07:23 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, always depending on the tournament being ran
11 Oct 2017 00:07:28 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, mk
11 Oct 2017 00:07:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so ill just make it an argument
11 Oct 2017 00:07:34 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, and see where it goes
11 Oct 2017 00:07:37 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like this is just a tst one
11 Oct 2017 00:07:40 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, mhm
11 Oct 2017 00:08:20 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i might increase the points though since i am planning to held different tournaments each month like 1 nonlegendary 1 legendaries accepted
11 Oct 2017 00:08:46 : imaqtpie #1 fans <3, gayers, TomTheMomIsDank#0668, why cant my ranked games be like this
11 Oct 2017 00:08:58 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, mhm
11 Oct 2017 00:09:28 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, dat moment when you just started up mc https://gyazo.com/7ec65a884bf62f7ebc4ef26b6c3487b5
11 Oct 2017 00:09:34 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, xd
11 Oct 2017 00:11:02 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its just weird that the {{player}} placeholder is acting weird
11 Oct 2017 00:11:12 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so
11 Oct 2017 00:11:15 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, what im thinking is wrong there
11 Oct 2017 00:11:23 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Mr.Jello#8408, Boorad?
11 Oct 2017 00:11:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, it might be processing it wrongly
11 Oct 2017 00:11:46 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so the enjin command actually runs with {{player}}
11 Oct 2017 00:11:50 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, instead of the actual name
11 Oct 2017 00:12:07 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, and im hoping that with an extra processing step it will actually use it
11 Oct 2017 00:12:08 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but
11 Oct 2017 00:12:21 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, mk
11 Oct 2017 00:12:25 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so i have something ready to try
11 Oct 2017 00:12:27 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well its a placeholder used by the tournament sidemod and the enjin command looks like this
11 Oct 2017 00:12:34 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, /enjin addpoints [player] [amount]
11 Oct 2017 00:12:41 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, yeah i have seen
11 Oct 2017 00:12:51 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, wait here let me try something
11 Oct 2017 00:12:55 : CrystalFantasy, memememememe, Mr.Jello#8408, XD

11 Oct 2017 00:16:07 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, it has no issue
11 Oct 2017 00:16:14 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, processing for the announcement
11 Oct 2017 00:16:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but it does for the enjin command

11 Oct 2017 00:17:06 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so it has an issue processing the placeholder
11 Oct 2017 00:17:18 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i tried all place holders there are
11 Oct 2017 00:17:24 : CrystalFantasy, memememememe, Mr.Jello#8408,

11 Oct 2017 00:18:26 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, that isn't a command it is processed within the mod
11 Oct 2017 00:18:32 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well its not the {{player}} placholder
11 Oct 2017 00:18:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, right
11 Oct 2017 00:18:34 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, yeah
11 Oct 2017 00:18:38 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, it processes inside and takes the name
11 Oct 2017 00:18:50 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, "winnerMessage": "\u00266The tournament has ended! Congratulations {{winners}}\u00266!",
11 Oct 2017 00:19:04 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, have you tried that placeholder
11 Oct 2017 00:19:10 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, *probably*
11 Oct 2017 00:19:14 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the place holder {{winners}} lemme try lol

11 Oct 2017 00:21:57 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so it isn't processing the placeholders
11 Oct 2017 00:22:21 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i have a method *and another after that MAYBE*
11 Oct 2017 00:22:30 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but it requires adding a plugin and therefore a restart
11 Oct 2017 00:22:30 : CrystalFantasy, memememememe, Mr.Jello#8408, 
11 Oct 2017 00:22:41 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, can y send me the url to that plugin?

11 Oct 2017 00:23:11 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i wrote a command that you would change the reward to
11 Oct 2017 00:23:30 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, and then it might work
11 Oct 2017 00:23:38 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but im having doubts it would process
11 Oct 2017 00:23:39 : Kernal Official, pokemon, Botfuzzy77#2209,

11 Oct 2017 00:23:54 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, cause if the placeholder is broken im not sure another step inside would work
11 Oct 2017 00:24:09 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so you wanna make it so that the commands we try to run run trough this plugin which defines the command different?
11 Oct 2017 00:24:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, basically
11 Oct 2017 00:24:31 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, first try to make it work
11 Oct 2017 00:24:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, would be
11 Oct 2017 00:24:44 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, the reward changes to a new command made with this plugin
11 Oct 2017 00:24:51 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which basically just runs the enjin addpoints command
11 Oct 2017 00:25:05 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, BUT it would add an extra step inbetween to possibly process the placeholder
11 Oct 2017 00:25:07 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, BradBrass#8693, i like it
11 Oct 2017 00:25:11 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but how are you going to define the player? lel
11 Oct 2017 00:25:14 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which im not 100% convinced would work
11 Oct 2017 00:25:17 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Mr.Jello#8408, Cool
11 Oct 2017 00:25:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which then gets to the next part
11 Oct 2017 00:25:30 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which is where we make it run a whole script of commands to give them permission to us a command
11 Oct 2017 00:25:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, sudo them
11 Oct 2017 00:25:33 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, then remove it
11 Oct 2017 00:25:42 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, or give them it temporarily for like, 1 second
11 Oct 2017 00:25:46 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so it goes away anyway
11 Oct 2017 00:26:07 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, wait 😃 lets try this out ^^ i'l install the plugin and see where we end up
11 Oct 2017 00:26:11 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which basically would be
11 Oct 2017 00:26:15 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i make a command that
11 Oct 2017 00:26:31 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, lemme think of how to do the second one
11 Oct 2017 00:26:36 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, it is smarter and would work better
11 Oct 2017 00:26:38 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, just needa make the 2 commands
11 Oct 2017 00:26:55 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, so command 1 would be like
11 Oct 2017 00:27:27 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, gimmie a few minutes to work out how i would do it
11 Oct 2017 00:27:32 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, then see if i can write it up
11 Oct 2017 00:28:07 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, want me to add the plugin anyway?
11 Oct 2017 00:28:22 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i mean it will be needed but there is a friendly player on :3
11 Oct 2017 00:28:40 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, meh the restart is nearby anyways lel
11 Oct 2017 00:28:47 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, you can add it
11 Oct 2017 00:28:58 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but dont force the restart
11 Oct 2017 00:28:59 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, we can wait
11 Oct 2017 00:29:13 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, do regular players have the ability to use @p
11 Oct 2017 00:29:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, :thonk:
11 Oct 2017 00:29:52 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well lel they should do since @p is a vanilla command
11 Oct 2017 00:29:57 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, yeah
11 Oct 2017 00:30:01 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, ill assume they do
11 Oct 2017 00:30:12 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, TIME TO SEE IF I CAN MAKE IT WORK D:

11 Oct 2017 00:35:22 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i need 2-3 commands made to make it work
11 Oct 2017 00:35:51 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm thn we might face another problem though lel
11 Oct 2017 00:36:10 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, wat
11 Oct 2017 00:36:12 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, since {{player}} and {{winners}} aint processed how are we gonna do /sudo?

11 Oct 2017 00:36:28 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, not with those
11 Oct 2017 00:36:31 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but with another method
11 Oct 2017 00:36:33 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, 😉
11 Oct 2017 00:37:44 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, k
11 Oct 2017 00:37:47 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, starting my test server now
11 Oct 2017 00:38:33 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, you want the preset file?
11 Oct 2017 00:39:21 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, im not gonna need the tournaments thing set up
11 Oct 2017 00:39:26 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i needa test the commands im making
11 Oct 2017 00:39:33 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, and if they process to obtain infromation correctly

11 Oct 2017 00:39:44 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, the tournaments thing will just start the script
11 Oct 2017 00:39:50 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, which will get all the information for us
11 Oct 2017 00:40:04 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, maybe

11 Oct 2017 00:40:21 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if we can do that we don't have to struggle with customnpcs and quests for the tourney
11 Oct 2017 00:40:34 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cause we'll have to make the quests for a storyline + side quests already

11 Oct 2017 01:58:08 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, they were writing the storage for the update
11 Oct 2017 01:58:10 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i think
11 Oct 2017 01:58:12 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 01:58:42 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i could ask him
11 Oct 2017 01:58:49 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, *think it is a him*

11 Oct 2017 01:59:41 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, even if oyu offered money
11 Oct 2017 01:59:55 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but
11 Oct 2017 01:59:56 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, maybe
11 Oct 2017 02:00:04 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, most pixelmon devs just abide by the dmca with everything related
11 Oct 2017 02:00:05 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
11 Oct 2017 02:00:23 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well lol only the pixelmonmod itself got DMCAD not the sidemods lel
11 Oct 2017 02:00:27 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, yeah
11 Oct 2017 02:00:33 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but most of them were related to both projects
11 Oct 2017 02:00:42 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, or because they were intended for use with the actual mod
11 Oct 2017 02:00:46 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, not the continuations
11 Oct 2017 02:00:48 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, they dont udpate them
11 Oct 2017 02:00:49 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 02:01:00 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, would be cool though if he moved on making it for generations :/
11 Oct 2017 02:01:19 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 02:01:23 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but yeh they are like "Its an illegal mod i cant help you with that"
11 Oct 2017 02:01:28 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i mean
11 Oct 2017 02:01:35 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, i dont blame them
11 Oct 2017 02:01:38 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, the mod is shady and stuff
11 Oct 2017 02:01:52 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, and they openly say "yeah we are already doing this illegally, now we are gonna steal more from pokemon"
11 Oct 2017 02:02:01 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well there are still alot of pixelmon servers out there so why not just keep it updated for em?
11 Oct 2017 02:02:09 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 02:02:18 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, ill try and ask them in a minute or two

11 Oct 2017 02:11:55 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, what is the issue
11 Oct 2017 02:13:25 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like the way he defined {{player}} ->  \\{\\{player}\\}\\
11 Oct 2017 02:14:33 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, uh
11 Oct 2017 02:14:58 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, https://gyazo.com/37af52124a1df9693e860b8d700ff479
11 Oct 2017 02:15:15 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, that might just be how you are supposed to
11 Oct 2017 02:15:19 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 02:15:21 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, cause of formatting
11 Oct 2017 02:15:22 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but
11 Oct 2017 02:15:37 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, feel free to try with the way it is wrote there
11 Oct 2017 02:18:24 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lets see
11 Oct 2017 02:26:05 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well that worked lol
11 Oct 2017 02:26:10 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, didi it
11 Oct 2017 02:26:13 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, lol
11 Oct 2017 02:26:30 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, now i just have to do /start to reboot the server >:)
11 Oct 2017 02:26:37 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, lol
11 Oct 2017 02:27:59 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lets hope the way it is placed there does work >_<
11 Oct 2017 02:28:42 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, wait a second
11 Oct 2017 02:28:52 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i see where he messed up lel
11 Oct 2017 02:28:58 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, what did he do
11 Oct 2017 02:28:59 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, : ^)
11 Oct 2017 02:29:21 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so the thing looks like this public void give(Player player)
  {
    if (command.startsWith("/"))
      command = command.replace("/", "");
    command.replaceAll("\\{\\{player\\}\\}", player.getName());
    Sponge.getGame().getCommandManager().process(Sponge.getServer().getConsole(), command);
  }
11 Oct 2017 02:29:26 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but what he forgot was
11 Oct 2017 02:29:42 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, to replace the \
11 Oct 2017 02:30:38 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like where it says if (command.startsWith("/"))
command = command.replace("/","");
11 Oct 2017 02:30:52 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but then for "\","");
11 Oct 2017 02:30:59 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, \*
11 Oct 2017 02:31:06 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, shitty slash -_-
11 Oct 2017 02:31:08 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\
11 Oct 2017 02:31:26 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, idk
11 Oct 2017 02:32:03 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well he is replacing all "/" but he does not replace the \\\
11 Oct 2017 02:32:24 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cause you replace \\ with spaces or nothing
11 Oct 2017 02:33:12 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but since \\ is not replaced with either spaces or "" the plugin will always return error
11 Oct 2017 02:33:29 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, but
11 Oct 2017 02:33:35 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, for commands you use /
11 Oct 2017 02:33:37 : PokeIslands, staff, LoneWolffy#4642, not \
11 Oct 2017 02:33:51 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yeh for commands you use / but you also have to replace the \\ s
11 Oct 2017 02:34:06 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cause \\ does not define anything

11 Oct 2017 02:51:27 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ok so this looks weird
11 Oct 2017 02:51:59 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, winner defines the player who wins the tournament but then when you do winners as the value it is saying its not correct
11 Oct 2017 02:52:11 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i just checked that .class file and it is also stating winner

11 Oct 2017 11:18:18 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, @DeMadViper  on the hotel can you move the stairs back a little it makes it hard to enter the suite infront of it
11 Oct 2017 11:20:05 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, also thank you for your hard work ❤
11 Oct 2017 11:20:11 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, it looks AMAZING
11 Oct 2017 11:21:42 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, The stairs was most definitely tiger... And yes I can
11 Oct 2017 11:22:11 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, ty dmv and @🐯Tiger🐅  ty also for your work on the hotel
11 Oct 2017 11:22:21 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, im making the rooms now
11 Oct 2017 11:22:29 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Ok
11 Oct 2017 11:22:51 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Make sure there's a painting and clock in all the smaller rooms
11 Oct 2017 11:23:22 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Third floor and up
11 Oct 2017 11:23:28 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, im mostly just gonna do floor one for now
11 Oct 2017 11:23:35 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Ok
11 Oct 2017 11:23:35 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, figuring out the commands was hard as heck
11 Oct 2017 11:23:47 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, tthe signs wouldnt work but i found out i had change the name of the hotel lol
11 Oct 2017 11:23:52 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, so now it works
11 Oct 2017 11:24:13 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, apparently putting Hotel as hotel name breaks the hotel
11 Oct 2017 11:24:23 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Wow
11 Oct 2017 11:24:29 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, lol ikr
11 Oct 2017 11:24:39 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, also later i will need some testers for rooms
11 Oct 2017 11:24:45 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Call it Questy Inn
11 Oct 2017 11:25:01 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, i try name it Goddess Tuna but only Goddess went in lol
11 Oct 2017 11:25:10 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, XD
11 Oct 2017 11:25:20 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, so now its the Goddess Hotel
11 Oct 2017 11:26:29 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, i have 1k for 30 days and then the suites for 5k for 30 days
11 Oct 2017 11:26:56 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Ok but the suites are different

11 Oct 2017 11:27:15 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, that why they higher
11 Oct 2017 11:27:40 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, I would argue that the enchanting room is the most valuable
11 Oct 2017 11:28:08 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, well i would do 10k but getting money maybe a bit tricky for players since
11 Oct 2017 11:28:15 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, i will havebuilding off
11 Oct 2017 11:28:23 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, they have survival but will not be able to build
11 Oct 2017 11:29:53 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, To be fair tho if we are giving away lv 30 enchantment table it better be hard for players 😂😂😂
11 Oct 2017 11:30:14 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, lol
11 Oct 2017 11:31:33 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, I'd say 8k 4k 1k
11 Oct 2017 11:31:49 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Actually no
11 Oct 2017 11:32:16 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, 8k 3k 1.5k
11 Oct 2017 11:32:28 : PokeIslands, staff, HD#6975, kms
11 Oct 2017 11:32:53 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, DeMadViper#5977, Enchanting suite, then suite, then classic room
11 Oct 2017 11:34:03 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, so basically just add enchanting room up 1 more
11 Oct 2017 11:34:10 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, 3 more
11 Oct 2017 11:38:15 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, there we go and im not fixing every room
11 Oct 2017 11:38:23 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, that made the room delete lol
