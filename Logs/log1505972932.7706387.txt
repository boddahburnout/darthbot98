21 Sep 2017 10:16:14 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Prof. Eevee#3955, I find reborn better bc they don't make up lies to get people to use their mod unlike the countless lies I got told by pixelmon dark staff
21 Sep 2017 10:16:48 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, Actually not true. They lie quite a bit.
21 Sep 2017 10:17:00 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, I'm on the side of neither so, I'm watching both their lies.
21 Sep 2017 10:17:26 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Prof. Eevee#3955, Yea but not how Dark did it to me I ended up getting a virus from one of the dark staff
21 Sep 2017 10:17:46 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, Like how after Dark claimed Reborn stole code (Which they hadn't) they stole the Gen 7 starters.
21 Sep 2017 10:18:10 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, Just to clarify, Reborn stole Dark's gen 7 starters.
21 Sep 2017 10:18:18 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, That's why they have the exact same glitches.
21 Sep 2017 10:20:39 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Prof. Eevee#3955, I don't pay attention to darks stuff any more the only time I do it is when taking dark code making a custom file so models get fixed on my end

21 Sep 2017 11:13:09 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @​here Hey, sorry, just going to try and get on to restart it for you
21 Sep 2017 11:14:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Ok, it should be back up shortly
21 Sep 2017 11:14:56 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I've just literally no time to be doing this stuff anymore, hence why I put Mike in charge - but then he doesn't have time either so the whole thing is kinda fucked
21 Sep 2017 11:15:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, The only alternative is that we close it all down and say goodbye PG, so...
21 Sep 2017 11:15:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, :/
21 Sep 2017 11:15:39 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, cant shuck get access to the console? he is admin+ already
21 Sep 2017 11:15:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Ozicarus why dont you give the server managers access to console?
21 Sep 2017 11:15:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I need a static IP from shuck
21 Sep 2017 11:15:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh i see
21 Sep 2017 11:16:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If they have a VPN they can use or something, sure thing
21 Sep 2017 11:16:12 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But it doesn't work if I keep having to update their IP
21 Sep 2017 11:16:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, dyndns?
21 Sep 2017 11:16:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @shuck (SF3)  XD
21 Sep 2017 11:16:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, would be free, if set up right
21 Sep 2017 11:16:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Uhh, i'm not sure if that does what we need it to do...
21 Sep 2017 11:17:14 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Also IE is not coming back up, it keeps crashing
21 Sep 2017 11:17:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I really don't have the time to fix this
21 Sep 2017 11:17:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i guess its time to say goodbye to IE XD
21 Sep 2017 11:17:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It was bad enough that I basically redid the whole thing on a shoestrng a few days ago
21 Sep 2017 11:17:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's still running on the backup drive ffs
21 Sep 2017 11:18:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, is that why it keeps crashing?
21 Sep 2017 11:18:11 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So yeah, I guess maybe say goodbye to IE because I can't tie myself down to this anymore, it's just not going to work
21 Sep 2017 11:18:11 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, No
21 Sep 2017 11:18:20 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's unrelated, but it should've been moved to the SSD at some point
21 Sep 2017 11:18:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's not backing up
21 Sep 2017 11:19:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, Maybe ask some of your admins if they would take over the role of manager
21 Sep 2017 11:19:16 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, theres already a server manager
21 Sep 2017 11:19:16 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, also @Royalsfan10 (IE)
21 Sep 2017 11:19:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, with no console access :3
21 Sep 2017 11:19:27 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, The issue is, even if I give these people console access
21 Sep 2017 11:19:39 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I don't even think they know how to run a server besides starting/stopping
21 Sep 2017 11:19:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So if it fucks itself, there's not really much chance they can fix it
21 Sep 2017 11:20:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, learning by doing, anything is better than just shut it down :/
21 Sep 2017 11:20:21 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, You say that...
21 Sep 2017 11:20:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, at the way the servers going, and the fact that mike and ozi are busy which is understandable
21 Sep 2017 11:20:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, at this rate closing up would be the best option
21 Sep 2017 11:20:55 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, :/
21 Sep 2017 11:21:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, not that i want that to happen
21 Sep 2017 11:21:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I am willing and able to hand over console, but it's just that I don't think we have the people who can do it
21 Sep 2017 11:21:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, but at the way its going its gunna happen sooner or later. were loosing more and more players each day. ive seen several people quite because somethings broken that stops them from playing
21 Sep 2017 11:22:02 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, cant royalsfan handle this ?
21 Sep 2017 11:22:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, so we need someone with experience in that....
21 Sep 2017 11:22:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, tbh i dont think they will actually know what to do to fix it. i mean. they could try, but its also possible to make it worse
21 Sep 2017 11:22:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, basically @Jimmy (IE)
21 Sep 2017 11:22:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, worse? xD
21 Sep 2017 11:22:36 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, its not running
21 Sep 2017 11:22:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, royals must have his server manager rank for a reason right o.o
21 Sep 2017 11:22:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, even if they delete it, that wouldnt be worse than shutting it down forever
21 Sep 2017 11:22:54 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, doesnt he know what to do?
21 Sep 2017 11:23:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Lol no
21 Sep 2017 11:23:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, That's not how it worked
21 Sep 2017 11:23:28 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We just promoted admins
21 Sep 2017 11:23:40 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, server manager doesnt mean they know how to run a server
21 Sep 2017 11:23:40 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, thats how mister got mod
21 Sep 2017 11:23:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, :p
21 Sep 2017 11:24:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, hm I see
21 Sep 2017 11:24:02 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol very clever empty XD
21 Sep 2017 11:24:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, D:
21 Sep 2017 11:24:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, What we can do is release the map
21 Sep 2017 11:24:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So that if someone wants to take it away and recreate the server, they can
21 Sep 2017 11:24:48 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, man I hate this. I havent been here for a very long time but seen countless communities disband ;-;
21 Sep 2017 11:25:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, This has been going on for over a year now
21 Sep 2017 11:25:07 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Was bound to happen once we hit uni
21 Sep 2017 11:25:31 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, thing is, both the servers are having issues and the people that can actually fix them have real lifes to get on with. its understandable
21 Sep 2017 11:25:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i knew straight away that as soon as they went to uni there was gunna be issues
21 Sep 2017 11:26:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, 😭
21 Sep 2017 11:27:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ive seen so many people join skyfactory and then complain that they cant create an islandso leave instantly
21 Sep 2017 11:27:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I don't see that getting fixed
21 Sep 2017 11:27:17 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, we all knew it as gunna happen at some point
21 Sep 2017 11:27:36 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Realistically, not being arrogant at all - I am the only one who can fix most of these issues
21 Sep 2017 11:27:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And I just don't have the time to sit for hours doing so
21 Sep 2017 11:28:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i know a lot about running a server. but ive never dealt with a moddedserver before so i have no idea what goes on in the backend
21 Sep 2017 11:28:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Same thing as vanilla, virtually
21 Sep 2017 11:28:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Just a few mod errors to deal with
21 Sep 2017 11:29:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, at the end of the day ozi its yours and mikes server, your the ones that decide where it goes from here
21 Sep 2017 11:30:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Well it depends if @Mike will have time
21 Sep 2017 11:30:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, we havnt seen you or mike for quite a few days now, so my guess is he wont, same as you
21 Sep 2017 11:30:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If neither of us do, and there's nobody else to take over, it can't run further
21 Sep 2017 11:31:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, tbh a final decision cant really be made until we see mike around
21 Sep 2017 11:31:55 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I'll leave it to him then
21 Sep 2017 11:32:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If he says yes, I will zip the maps, configs and non-sensitive plugin files up and put them on the website
21 Sep 2017 11:32:43 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And maybe someone can continue it
21 Sep 2017 11:33:01 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @Bl0k (IE) I have the tekkit map too
21 Sep 2017 11:34:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, okay that sounds fair. im sure theres someone that would take it on.
21 Sep 2017 11:34:32 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its an amazing server
21 Sep 2017 11:35:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I don't think it'd be too sad to be honest, it has had a really good run
21 Sep 2017 11:35:20 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, No server goes on forever
21 Sep 2017 11:35:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, exactly
21 Sep 2017 11:35:40 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, even all them really huge servers will end one day
21 Sep 2017 11:36:09 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Those guys at hive, hypixel etc. all have professional IT guys running theirs, which helps...
21 Sep 2017 11:36:37 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yeah. plus they all dedicate their time to it. hard to dedicate time to a server when your in uni aha

21 Sep 2017 11:37:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol
21 Sep 2017 11:38:25 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, it will be sad to see the server go. but it is what it is. everything happens for a reason. im assuming the discord will stay open?
21 Sep 2017 11:38:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yes
21 Sep 2017 11:38:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Website can continue for a few months

21 Sep 2017 11:46:37 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, if Oz is ok for it to be PGN it's PGN if not It's going to be BGN
21 Sep 2017 11:46:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, lol
21 Sep 2017 11:46:46 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, BGN??
21 Sep 2017 11:46:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It can be PGN if you want
21 Sep 2017 11:46:52 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, (Bl0k Gaming Network)

21 Sep 2017 11:47:20 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, at least then you will be keeping the PGN brand going
21 Sep 2017 11:47:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Genuinely - if anyone wants to continue a server, you can use the PGN name/logo everything - and I will host the site and point the domain for you
21 Sep 2017 11:48:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, I mean.. we can just wait for ozi to finish UNI and everything is good ?

21 Sep 2017 11:48:35 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, thats not true mister
21 Sep 2017 11:48:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i mean, i was thinking of running a server. but idk if id have the time for it
21 Sep 2017 11:48:48 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, some servers/ clans whatever survive
21 Sep 2017 11:48:54 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's horrible but really great
21 Sep 2017 11:49:14 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Some days you feel so proud, some days you want to murder your playerbase
21 Sep 2017 11:49:21 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, Hey I just got home I was sent home early
21 Sep 2017 11:49:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol
21 Sep 2017 11:49:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I've learned a lot though, so it was worthwhile - i'm glad I did it
21 Sep 2017 11:50:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, runing  a server is like runing a company
21 Sep 2017 11:50:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, not really
21 Sep 2017 11:50:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, you gotta know what ya doing
21 Sep 2017 11:50:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, u have no income
21 Sep 2017 11:50:40 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We have shareholders - the players
21 Sep 2017 11:50:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, donations
21 Sep 2017 11:50:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Empty Child PGN had an income...
21 Sep 2017 11:50:55 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, it is technically like running a business
21 Sep 2017 11:51:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We don't make much money though
21 Sep 2017 11:51:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, just saying company and running a server isnt  remotely the same 😛
21 Sep 2017 11:51:26 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, Oz can you put me in creative. need to finish builing IKEA
21 Sep 2017 11:51:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, in some ways yes it is
21 Sep 2017 11:51:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Some aspects are *similar*
21 Sep 2017 11:51:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But yeah, they're two different things
21 Sep 2017 11:51:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ^^
21 Sep 2017 11:51:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, anywayyyy XD
21 Sep 2017 11:52:03 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, TC can't get donations like IE
21 Sep 2017 11:52:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Right I need to go so byeeeeee
21 Sep 2017 11:52:07 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, show me a company in which mister would be mod :3 'second shot fired.
21 Sep 2017 11:52:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @Mike Decide pls
21 Sep 2017 11:52:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, cya ozi
21 Sep 2017 11:52:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and btw, tagging him is useless XD weve tagged him a LOT XD
21 Sep 2017 11:52:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Bl0k (IE) why cant it?

21 Sep 2017 11:54:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, some stupid agrement or somthing. some plugin used in geting players donator items from paying money in older versions of minecraft
21 Sep 2017 11:54:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ohhhh
21 Sep 2017 11:54:22 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, buycraft?
21 Sep 2017 11:54:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and the EULA
21 Sep 2017 11:54:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, they can donate but you have to add the donator perks manuly
21 Sep 2017 11:54:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, theres other ways of setting up donations
21 Sep 2017 11:55:01 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, it will always be possible, but you have to know what is and isnt against the eula
21 Sep 2017 11:55:31 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, as long asthe stuff people donate for is also available IN GAME then its all good
21 Sep 2017 11:55:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so as long as its gettable without donating then its not against the EULA
21 Sep 2017 11:56:14 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and even then, you wont get noticed if your ARE going against the EULA until your server becomes REALLYYY big.
21 Sep 2017 11:56:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, so if i make donator perks awaleble after 10k houres im fine
21 Sep 2017 11:56:55 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yeah
21 Sep 2017 11:57:22 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, you can make it so they have to have a 1 year playtime to get all the donator perks, its still going along with the EULA
21 Sep 2017 11:57:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its just in that fine line, it would be more frowned upon than being against the EULA
21 Sep 2017 11:58:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, when they brought that blacklist into place i had to read through the end users license agreement to see if there was a way around it.
21 Sep 2017 11:58:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, cos at that time i was hosting my server
21 Sep 2017 11:59:03 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, so like put 1k houres for the lowerst donations and 5k for the higest
21 Sep 2017 11:59:10 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yeah, thats allowed
21 Sep 2017 11:59:14 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, you can just add it manuly
21 Sep 2017 11:59:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if you use an auto ranking plugin you can make it give them the ranks automatically when they reach thus playtime
21 Sep 2017 12:01:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, Oz will probobly send ower the files and if not i can just generate a new map(even if i wold like my old place back)
21 Sep 2017 12:01:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol
21 Sep 2017 12:01:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, miss my city and ships
21 Sep 2017 12:01:35 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, but what about all the other random builds that would be there
21 Sep 2017 12:01:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, nuke them
21 Sep 2017 12:01:48 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i mean, you could install world edit, and world edit your old base into a new map
21 Sep 2017 12:01:56 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, or copy my place on to a new map
21 Sep 2017 12:02:01 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i beat ya to it XD
21 Sep 2017 12:02:39 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, i used world edit to make it snowy in the winter and green after like a week
21 Sep 2017 12:02:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol
21 Sep 2017 12:03:02 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, well if you ever want any help with ya server gimme a shout. ill probably play on it anyways
21 Sep 2017 12:03:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, i will
21 Sep 2017 12:04:05 : Achievement Heaven, ah-general, Dragonia#4730, Hewwo
21 Sep 2017 12:04:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ive been trying to find a replacement for SF3 because im getting bored of it lol

21 Sep 2017 12:07:12 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, server restart im guessing
21 Sep 2017 12:07:39 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Maarnt#2560, So is IE officially getting the axe then?
21 Sep 2017 12:07:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, not yet
21 Sep 2017 12:07:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, we need mikes decision on the whole situation
21 Sep 2017 12:08:01 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so for now it looks like its all good
21 Sep 2017 12:09:02 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Maarnt#2560, I'd think the opposite. The fact that no one has heard from him in over a day seems to point to it being all bad.
21 Sep 2017 12:09:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Gotenix#2540, ty
21 Sep 2017 12:09:27 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its cos hes at uni. hell be here when he has the chance
21 Sep 2017 12:09:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Maarnt#2560, Exactly. And then probably arrive at the same conclusion as Ozi.
21 Sep 2017 12:09:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, We can't k ow that until he says it
21 Sep 2017 12:10:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Until then it's pointless speculation
21 Sep 2017 12:10:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, exactly
21 Sep 2017 12:10:32 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ozi cant make a decision without mike
21 Sep 2017 12:11:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KidKraft#7732, Welcome

21 Sep 2017 12:12:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, There are many solutions to the problem, we just have to find the best one. If that means closing up shop, so be it

21 Sep 2017 12:14:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, IE have been down a lot recently right?
21 Sep 2017 12:15:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Yeah
21 Sep 2017 12:15:36 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Because ozi doesn't have time to fix the issues
21 Sep 2017 12:16:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, TC lost a lot of players becus of down time
21 Sep 2017 12:30:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, well the PGN name will always continue

21 Sep 2017 12:41:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i want to run a server under the PGN name to keep it going, but i dont know if i will be able to afford it 😦
21 Sep 2017 12:42:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Bl0k (IE) how are you even gunna afford to run a server that big o_O
21 Sep 2017 12:49:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, mister have you tried modern skyblock 2 ?
21 Sep 2017 12:50:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, nope.
21 Sep 2017 12:52:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, should give that a shot
21 Sep 2017 12:52:52 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, maybe
21 Sep 2017 12:53:16 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, im just thinking about what to do if i was to run a server. id probably run it from my computer, but id need a dedicated pc just for the server
21 Sep 2017 12:53:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, modern skyblock is afaik a progressive pack
21 Sep 2017 12:53:37 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, dunno if u like that
21 Sep 2017 12:53:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, kinda
21 Sep 2017 12:53:54 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, with quests
21 Sep 2017 12:53:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, I think
21 Sep 2017 12:54:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, idk. rn im trying to sort an issue with an ipad i bought as the seller is getting really nasty towards me
21 Sep 2017 12:54:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, nasty :3?
21 Sep 2017 12:54:31 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, threatening to call the police because i havnt paid him yet
21 Sep 2017 12:54:46 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, the funds go to the people that run the app and once i leave a rating on the item they send the funds to him
21 Sep 2017 12:54:54 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, well if you didnt pay
21 Sep 2017 12:54:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, isnt that the correct thing to do ?
21 Sep 2017 12:55:12 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, but im tryng to return the item, as its useless
21 Sep 2017 12:55:20 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its basically an expensive paper weight
21 Sep 2017 12:55:34 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, ?
21 Sep 2017 12:55:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, why did you buy it then
21 Sep 2017 12:55:48 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, because i didnt know it was icloud locked to someones account
21 Sep 2017 12:56:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, can you return it ?
21 Sep 2017 12:56:09 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, when i asked him about it and said can i havethe account he said its his ex girlfriends account and he has no way to contact her
21 Sep 2017 12:56:25 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yh i can return it, and i am, thats why he hasnt recieved the money yet
21 Sep 2017 12:56:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, I mean are you allowed by whatever terms you agreed to when u bought it
21 Sep 2017 12:56:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, to return it
21 Sep 2017 12:57:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, mhm
21 Sep 2017 12:57:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if the item isnt as described im allowed to return it
21 Sep 2017 12:57:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, did you buy it on ebay ?
21 Sep 2017 12:57:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, no, a second hand site app thing called mercari
21 Sep 2017 12:58:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Empty Child#5717, well ebay is really good with protecting people from scam imo. if mercari has similar terms there should be no issue

21 Sep 2017 13:45:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, Running a server like IE on your PC isnt going to be worthwhile

21 Sep 2017 13:47:42 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, because i was in a biology class and i almost fainted just getting out

21 Sep 2017 13:49:11 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, i will have to shut down the server for like 1-2 houres every 4 weeks
21 Sep 2017 13:49:21 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ_Phatzo#8045, Everyone go to your Facebook accounts, and try this. I have a fuck ton of people following my account, and I have no idea who they are

21 Sep 2017 14:26:23 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Bl0k (IE) if i was going to run a server from my pc i would have a seperate pc dedicated to the server
21 Sep 2017 14:26:33 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if not i would just use a host website to do it for me
21 Sep 2017 14:27:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, Too many complications running it from your own active PC
21 Sep 2017 14:27:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, probobly going to buy a cheap computer and get more ram for it to run the server on it
21 Sep 2017 14:27:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if i make my own server im probably going to run it from a server host rather than a home pc, as i dont live alone so the internet will slow down for everyone else

21 Sep 2017 14:29:07 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i dont wanna spend anymore than $100 a month tho. which is gunna be hard if im running a modded server XD
21 Sep 2017 14:29:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, Yeah, those costs are pretty crazy
21 Sep 2017 14:30:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, for running a vanilla server its pretty good, but when you add mods to the mix it requires quite a bit of ram
21 Sep 2017 14:31:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Rent a dedicated machine
21 Sep 2017 14:31:52 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, Hmmmm
21 Sep 2017 14:32:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, Did they revert to a later save?
21 Sep 2017 14:32:35 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, on IE?
21 Sep 2017 14:33:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, SilverSurfer#4999, maybe some hours are lost, not too much

21 Sep 2017 15:15:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, still the problem remains...
21 Sep 2017 15:15:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, some one needs to manage it
21 Sep 2017 15:15:54 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809, Yes
21 Sep 2017 15:15:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, and apparently no one knows how?
21 Sep 2017 15:16:22 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, The current admins and managers would transfer, except for Oz and mike
21 Sep 2017 15:16:32 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809, 
21 Sep 2017 15:16:35 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, oz and mike are the only ones who know how :p
21 Sep 2017 15:16:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, We can ask them to train someone up
21 Sep 2017 15:16:42 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809, Thumbnails for a project
21 Sep 2017 15:16:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, If they can't full manage the server, they can link is resources and answer basic questions
21 Sep 2017 15:17:40 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809, Next are thumbnails for the next project I am doing
21 Sep 2017 15:17:46 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809,

21 Sep 2017 15:19:22 : zen koi, steamybotcenter, Melancholy#5809, K
21 Sep 2017 15:20:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if im honest, no offence to anyone that runs the server, but i dont see it going much further. because ozi and mike are gunna be busy A LOT. and thats nothing that can be helped.
21 Sep 2017 15:21:55 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, @PurrKoi
21 Sep 2017 15:21:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Hopefully they won't be needed to run it
21 Sep 2017 15:22:18 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Uploading
21 Sep 2017 15:22:20 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, 
21 Sep 2017 15:22:24 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, well obviously they will. they are the people with access to the files and console, they are the ones who know how to run it
21 Sep 2017 15:22:41 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Nope
21 Sep 2017 15:22:43 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and if their always busy their not going to have time to train someone to run it for them
21 Sep 2017 15:22:45 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Oz said he's willing to send the files over
21 Sep 2017 15:22:53 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yeah i know
21 Sep 2017 15:22:55 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, If someone else can take up the reigns
21 Sep 2017 15:22:55 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, XD
21 Sep 2017 15:23:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, And I don't mean train, I mean answer a few questions
21 Sep 2017 15:23:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if ozi sends someone the files then that person also needs to be able to foot the costs for the server, and its quite expensive
21 Sep 2017 15:24:12 : Cipher, general, Sacramentum#8702, @Dudubidu
21 Sep 2017 15:24:21 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, you apaprently missed the conversation where we discussed the cost of a server. Its actually only a few dollars a month
21 Sep 2017 15:24:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, or euros as the case may be
21 Sep 2017 15:24:32 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, XD
21 Sep 2017 15:24:37 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, or sek for me
21 Sep 2017 15:24:47 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, All of these are past homework
21 Sep 2017 15:24:49 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Right
21 Sep 2017 15:25:11 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh i might have as i had to do the school run
21 Sep 2017 15:25:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, how  would it only be a few dollars though?
21 Sep 2017 15:25:59 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Yeth
21 Sep 2017 15:26:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, surely running such a large modpack would require a pretty beefy server
21 Sep 2017 15:26:18 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, It's not server hosting, it's renting a VM or dedicated machine
21 Sep 2017 15:26:21 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, XD
21 Sep 2017 15:26:26 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Soooooooo
21 Sep 2017 15:26:37 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Got any new dragons?
21 Sep 2017 15:26:38 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Which itself is cheaper
21 Sep 2017 15:26:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i know
21 Sep 2017 15:26:45 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, Aw
21 Sep 2017 15:26:54 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, sure need to rent a beefy one... but its a difference between 4$ and 13$ :p

21 Sep 2017 15:27:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ive just learned how to use hosts and found using them easier than learning how to host it from a VM

21 Sep 2017 15:28:01 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, when I first started it was 70$ a month or so... now its down to... pennies XD

21 Sep 2017 15:28:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Grenwolf#8599, If you can set up a server from one PC in your house hold to another machine in the household you can set up a VM
21 Sep 2017 15:28:46 : zen koi, art, Melancholy#5809, And one asked to buy them

21 Sep 2017 17:04:42 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, DigiBaka#8941, @๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily I'm kinda in the fence with them. Reborn pushes out so much more content faster, but Dark spends more time fixing bugs. But I've just now seen the newest version of Reborn cause I didn't have time to do either before, but it's really improved alot! It may be my new go to, but I like both!
21 Sep 2017 17:04:43 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, ItzBlaZzze#5611, should do
21 Sep 2017 17:04:47 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, ItzBlaZzze#5611, it does on my end

21 Sep 2017 17:04:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ah now it doe
21 Sep 2017 17:04:58 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, s
21 Sep 2017 17:05:22 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, Reborn is my go too because previously it was the other way around with Reborn having less glitches and such.
21 Sep 2017 17:05:34 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, Now tho, I'm just riding it out.

Weve had a couple little things with peoples money being reset, but that  can be simply fixed as an when it needs to

21 Sep 2017 21:42:50 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, CrazyGoatFTW#2328, My wife left me, went away. At first I was sad, lonely and didn’t know what to do with myself. But I bought a motorbike, threw a wild, loud party and got to meet some other women. I think my wife may not be so pleased when she comes back again from work.
21 Sep 2017 21:43:32 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, CrazyGoatFTW#2328, My teacher asked me to characterize myself in 5 words.

21 Sep 2017 21:44:59 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, CrazyGoatFTW#2328, A police officer stops a car and says: “Congratulations, sir! You are the 1,000,000th car to drive over this bridge – you win $10,000! What will you do with that money?”

The driver gets very emotional and says, “First of all, I’ll finally make my driver’s license!” The wife cuts in, “Don’t listen to him, officer, he’s still drunk!”

A hard-of-hearing granny from the back seat grumbles, “I knew we shouldn’t have taken the stolen car!”

A voice from the trunk adds, “Hey, are we past the border now?”

22 Sep 2017 22:15:16 : Legacy Craft, updates, EmMiERoSe#7854, @​everyone you can now craft a emerald block for a special reason... What you ask? STORING XP/LEVELS!!! Right click on a emerald block to turn all your accumulated levels into bottles of 64 xp/levels that you can throw at your feet later as needed.... FYI if you have a lot please make room in your inventory for the bottles or you may lose some xp/levels!

23 Sep 2017 04:39:30 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Yes
23 Sep 2017 04:39:44 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, You have to survive yes or no
23 Sep 2017 04:40:00 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Clever Name™#0982, I've only really cared about SF3
23 Sep 2017 04:40:04 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Wym like premise of eating and drinking
23 Sep 2017 04:40:06 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, ?
23 Sep 2017 04:40:14 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, i mean not die
23 Sep 2017 04:40:27 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, thats a no u only eat to regain health or stamina
23 Sep 2017 04:40:35 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, thats what i belive
23 Sep 2017 04:40:50 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, no i mean you need to not die as part of the game
23 Sep 2017 04:40:58 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Somehow a mod config was changed that stopped standard clients from logging in
23 Sep 2017 04:41:03 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Yea but thats EVERY GAME EVER
23 Sep 2017 04:41:16 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, not solitaire
23 Sep 2017 04:41:22 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, or checkers
23 Sep 2017 04:41:28 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, No even in solitaire
23 Sep 2017 04:41:31 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, or tetris
23 Sep 2017 04:41:31 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, and checkers too
23 Sep 2017 04:42:15 : PokeIslands, general, DimLittleMuffin#6142, //ip
23 Sep 2017 04:42:15 : PokeIslands, general, Arraybot#7471, the ip of our server is: playpokeislands.tk:27257
23 Sep 2017 04:42:16 : PokeIslands, general, Tatsumaki#8792, 🆙  |  **DimLittleMuffin leveled up!**
23 Sep 2017 04:42:20 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, So while the server was 'up' no one could log in without making a modification to the client side config files
23 Sep 2017 04:42:24 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, tetris u die if u lose, aka game over checkers u lose all ur pieces aka them dying, solitaire u die trying not to be bored to death
23 Sep 2017 04:42:39 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Empty Child#5717, ie has been up all the time
23 Sep 2017 04:42:42 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Empty Child#5717, unlike sf :c

23 Sep 2017 04:42:47 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Just watch the video
23 Sep 2017 04:43:00 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, No one could log on though
23 Sep 2017 04:43:05 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, there is no feasible character to die as so you can not die
23 Sep 2017 04:43:05 : PokeIslands, general, DimLittleMuffin#6142, whats the new ip
23 Sep 2017 04:43:25 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, When did sf go down?

23 Sep 2017 04:44:27 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, The feasible character is urself
23 Sep 2017 04:44:41 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, and most people die bc they get bored to death
23 Sep 2017 04:45:04 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, meh looks like this game would bore me to death
23 Sep 2017 04:45:13 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, THEN DONT PLAY IT

23 Sep 2017 09:06:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I just got pinged by ftbservers that one of them has been down over 24 hours @​everyone
23 Sep 2017 09:06:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So at this point, I can no longer afford to fix it, I went through this - I have tried but this isn't going to work
23 Sep 2017 09:07:04 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, I suppose mike is the only one who can do something?
23 Sep 2017 09:07:10 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Lolno
23 Sep 2017 09:07:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Short of a rebuild, properly, the servers are fucked - they've got a bunch of problems all showing themselves at once
23 Sep 2017 09:08:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, That's pretty bad
23 Sep 2017 09:08:09 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, xd
23 Sep 2017 09:08:31 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Mike can decide to end this, and I will upload the maps and plugins etc. To the website
23 Sep 2017 09:08:41 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So we wait for his response
23 Sep 2017 09:08:43 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, End it as in shut the server down?
23 Sep 2017 09:08:56 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yes
23 Sep 2017 09:09:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, Ah, I see
23 Sep 2017 09:09:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because im done, sorry
23 Sep 2017 09:09:12 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, It's not your fault
23 Sep 2017 09:09:29 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, You tried your best and were an amazing owner for as long as I've been a part of the community
23 Sep 2017 09:09:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, I can houst a tekkit Classic server so pgn can continue.
23 Sep 2017 09:10:08 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Funny thing with TC is that it still mostly works lol
23 Sep 2017 09:10:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, What I've noticed recently is that most minecraft servers are falling to ruin
23 Sep 2017 09:10:44 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, People just dont want to play minecraft anymore it seems
23 Sep 2017 09:10:52 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Well that and uni
23 Sep 2017 09:10:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, Although hypixel is still going strong
23 Sep 2017 09:10:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It was predicted
23 Sep 2017 09:11:03 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, Wynncraft too, quite surprising
23 Sep 2017 09:11:15 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, I feel like most of the players got the game as kids
23 Sep 2017 09:11:26 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, And now have too many school errands to play
23 Sep 2017 09:11:30 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, Just like me xD
23 Sep 2017 09:12:03 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, On weekends there is always more players online.
23 Sep 2017 09:13:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, If you wold send ower the TC files i can start the server later today. After you instruct me how to set it up.
23 Sep 2017 09:13:27 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, @Ozicarus
23 Sep 2017 09:13:59 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, It still feels kinda sad to end it like this xD
23 Sep 2017 09:14:06 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MARKOO92#7788, I use "xD" too much i need to stop
23 Sep 2017 09:14:57 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, PGN is not going to end. Im going to try to houst TC on my computer for as long as i can.

23 Sep 2017 12:22:46 : PokeIslands, bot, Potatoelover21#7627, well crap
23 Sep 2017 12:23:37 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, Mike is not even fucking talking
23 Sep 2017 12:23:54 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, I do not have the time for this, I made this clear months ago - this is never going to be fixed and our listing was disabled because of the inactivity
23 Sep 2017 12:23:58 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, So basically it's dead
23 Sep 2017 12:24:26 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Well he's said jack shit to me
23 Sep 2017 12:24:40 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Probably
23 Sep 2017 12:24:51 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, SO - IN SUMMARY
23 Sep 2017 12:25:00 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Mike has gone AWOL, presumed busy because of uni
23 Sep 2017 12:25:47 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I cannot keep this up, I was nowhere near able to support the server to this kind of level; fixing the servers would take hours and hours - it's incredibly involved
23 Sep 2017 12:26:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So, in summary, we're likely going to be zipping up the maps, plugins etc. for you all and releasing them on the website to download for the next few months
23 Sep 2017 12:26:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Unfortunate that this is how it comes to an end after just over a year, but no server lasts forever and it's **not possible** to keep it going with the staff that we have
23 Sep 2017 12:28:24 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Hopefully one of you can, or knows somebody who can, continue something in some form - and of course the discord won't close
23 Sep 2017 12:37:00 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Maarnt#2560, Was fun while it lasted, wish you all the best.
23 Sep 2017 12:46:57 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Varijon#2825, Tekkit classic is sorta fun, played it a lot years ago.. just extremely hard to keep balanced lol (friggin EE2 and exploits)
Bit annoying that version of mc doesn't support the alex skin, might have my pre 1.8 skin laying around
23 Sep 2017 12:49:00 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, shuck#1142, @Ozicarus what if you gave the managers console then wouldn't we be able to help the server and keep it open
23 Sep 2017 13:07:44 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, darthgremlin1701#1407, Sorry to hear that Oz. well done for running the server as long as you have
23 Sep 2017 13:13:42 : Proton Gaming, staff_skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, need to read in gerneral guys @Jimmy (IE)  @Misterchamp (SF3)
23 Sep 2017 13:16:43 : Proton Gaming, staff_skyfactory, Jimmy#4999, yeah, since i asked that before 1 day, i got it already^^
23 Sep 2017 13:20:14 : Proton Gaming, staff_skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, ah ok
23 Sep 2017 13:20:18 : Proton Gaming, staff_skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, pity though
23 Sep 2017 13:20:30 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Bl0knedella#5724, TC is not about balance but to have fun building and exploring old mods.
23 Sep 2017 13:21:22 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Varijon#2825, Myeah, I loved making factories with the RP2 pipes
23 Sep 2017 13:30:05 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Bl0knedella#5724, Just dont copy Xerox base. It lagged the server.
23 Sep 2017 13:30:58 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Bl0knedella#5724, Maybe 50 EMC machine that pumped in to an chest.
23 Sep 2017 13:32:58 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Varijon#2825, Like flowers? or something else
Need none of that if blaze rod maceration isn't fixed xd
23 Sep 2017 13:37:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @Tornado (SF3) just to say, that idea about modded factions with guns was my idea. So don’t go claimin it as yours. That was the idea for my server
23 Sep 2017 13:37:48 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ;server
23 Sep 2017 13:37:51 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Botfuzzy77#2209, *Server is Down :(*

23 Sep 2017 13:39:34 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Clever Name™#0982, So just a quick question, did I hear that the entire map is gonna be available to download?
23 Sep 2017 13:51:39 : GreenHillGang, general, FunkyMonkey#0890, anyone going to the footbal game, i need a ride for pep band

23 Sep 2017 13:56:12 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yes
23 Sep 2017 13:56:50 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Lol, not exactly an original idea misterchamp
23 Sep 2017 13:57:14 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Has been done so many times, it won't work out - you need the backing of a youtuber or existing server to pull off a custom modpack server
23 Sep 2017 13:57:30 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, I said I can
23 Sep 2017 13:57:37 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, But you wouldn't even know where to start
23 Sep 2017 13:57:49 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, Ozicarus#8421, I barely know where to start
23 Sep 2017 13:58:15 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, If mike doesn't veto or something over the weekend i'll go ahead and do it
23 Sep 2017 13:58:33 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, We can't even pass off control to the managers, they wouldn't know what to do

23 Sep 2017 14:26:30 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Hounddog2021#6191, @​everyone I have offer Oz the option of allowing me to take control of the network and I have a plan that if he desires to here I will lay ou to him and all of you at a later date but for my plan to be success I need to know if there is a desire to keep this community allow. If people are intrested in keep it going, please just drop me a pm or show your support in the chat. So that we have an idea in terms of player numbers.

23 Sep 2017 15:22:42 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Yeah, but misterchamp and I were discussing running SF3 and IE

23 Sep 2017 15:23:53 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Hounddog2021#6191, @Bl0k (IE) and @Lieta (IE) I have am working on a plan that I will brief you on later provided Ozi is on broad with my take over idea. My plan will allow for everyone that is currently inplace to stay inplace and for us to get the TC server.
23 Sep 2017 15:24:46 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, And mike. Don't forget mike. He has to accept it as well
23 Sep 2017 15:25:02 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, They already told Blok he can run TC with PGN name
23 Sep 2017 15:25:17 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Hounddog2021#6191, I am aware of that.
23 Sep 2017 15:29:48 : Proton Gaming, staff_management, shuck#1142, Yeah but if it was to keep the server alive I would teach myself somehow
23 Sep 2017 15:32:17 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, I hope nobody bought my shop

23 Sep 2017 15:32:56 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, It's quite likely that the server is down for good
23 Sep 2017 15:33:02 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, is it?
23 Sep 2017 15:33:05 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Mhm
23 Sep 2017 15:33:19 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, We're working on a plan to save it, but for now it most likely is

23 Sep 2017 15:34:42 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Plus, the server had a meltdown basically
23 Sep 2017 15:35:57 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, 192.168.1.74:25565
i need someone to test if they can join
it's tekkit classic 3.12
23 Sep 2017 15:36:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, That looks like a local ip, not internet ip
23 Sep 2017 15:38:14 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, .....
23 Sep 2017 15:38:45 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, and how do i change it to an internet ip?
23 Sep 2017 15:39:24 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, One......  You should not have the IP address information filled out in the config file of the server if you are only running one server
23 Sep 2017 15:40:17 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, 2.  You have to set your router to properly route the associated port (25565) to the machine hosting (I assume in this case that is 192.168.1.74
23 Sep 2017 15:41:02 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, 3 google 'whats my ip' to get your home IP address
23 Sep 2017 15:41:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, 4.  No offense but not knowing this makes you a bit questionable as a host.
23 Sep 2017 15:42:34 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, first time not using hamatchi and you have to start somwhere
23 Sep 2017 15:43:38 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, It only gets harder.
23 Sep 2017 15:43:48 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, ISP can often be an issue hosting a server
23 Sep 2017 15:43:53 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, He's gotta learn
23 Sep 2017 15:43:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, can you message me instead?
23 Sep 2017 15:45:21 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I might not be available to respond immediately, but if you have a question you can PM me, Im doing a couple PC reloads and working on a MP3 player
23 Sep 2017 15:45:33 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, ok
23 Sep 2017 15:45:49 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Blok, read about this stuff online
23 Sep 2017 15:45:59 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Get a small team of people to help you test stuff
23 Sep 2017 15:46:23 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Who is your ISP?
23 Sep 2017 15:47:28 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, Telia
23 Sep 2017 15:47:34 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, More importantly, you should make sure that they dont have a no server clause
23 Sep 2017 15:47:49 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, And that you have like.. good upload lol
23 Sep 2017 15:49:01 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Oh yeah, Knowing your connection speed is pretty important
23 Sep 2017 15:49:14 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I often forget that having a gig line
23 Sep 2017 15:49:31 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Renting a dedicated machine would be a good idea
23 Sep 2017 15:49:57 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Oh certainly...
23 Sep 2017 15:50:02 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, They're not expensive, and it comes with the benefit of not tying up your home resources
23 Sep 2017 15:50:28 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Or at least if you run it from home make sure you have a dedicated machine and you are not just running it off your PC
23 Sep 2017 15:51:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Right
23 Sep 2017 15:51:13 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Bl0knedella#5724, im not seting up a huge server just for like 5 players

23 Sep 2017 16:13:08 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, if i took 1 screen shot of every hacker i find my intire 1tb of storage would be filled and i would need more
23 Sep 2017 16:13:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sacramentum#8702, @TheLast1Alive  all good papi. What are you playing these days?
23 Sep 2017 16:14:51 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Well good to know but
23 Sep 2017 16:15:07 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, You can easily report the bastard so

23 Sep 2017 16:15:51 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, But thats difficult to setup
23 Sep 2017 16:16:03 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, so most would usually have or make an alt account
23 Sep 2017 16:16:09 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Then the Mods or admins
23 Sep 2017 16:16:12 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, would see the IP

23 Sep 2017 18:48:14 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, shuck#1142, What u mean
23 Sep 2017 18:48:42 : Proton Gaming, skyfactory, Farbal#3327, If you read the past few posts, you will see that the word on the street is that the server will not be comeing back up

23 Sep 2017 18:56:45 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, @​everyone Alright, so kicked hounddog because I spend a long time talking to him and he's not a nice person. I've said he can go and set up servers of his own but we're certainly not endorsing or supporting him on that.
23 Sep 2017 18:57:23 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, SilverRose13#0794, Oh yikes,  that's good we found that out quickly
23 Sep 2017 18:58:20 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Royals and shuck will be getting console to see what they can make of it
23 Sep 2017 18:58:28 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, It's fine, you don't need to put effort in anything ozi, real life goes first and you have already really done so much. If someone can save this Server, it would be nice, but it's also okay if it is over
23 Sep 2017 18:58:30 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, And of course if they can't, I will be releasing the maps
23 Sep 2017 18:58:50 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I would rather have the maps be released to everyone than someone like that carry it forward
23 Sep 2017 18:58:57 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, heyy yall
23 Sep 2017 19:00:55 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, regan ata#3376, Mmmm kill me now XD
23 Sep 2017 19:01:24 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @​everyone I'm just going to make clear that i'm not angry if you decide to leap with hounddog to whatever shitheap he's going to form - i'll just think less of you
23 Sep 2017 19:01:43 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, You need to make it clear that he cant use the PGN name
23 Sep 2017 19:01:50 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Prick Gaming Network
23 Sep 2017 19:01:54 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, EZ
23 Sep 2017 19:01:58 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Bl0knedella#5724, it what im forming. he was helping me set up a Tekkit Classic server
23 Sep 2017 19:02:04 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, TC is dead
23 Sep 2017 19:02:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, It wasnt an awful idea, but it would need to be run by someone who the community knows and trusts
23 Sep 2017 19:02:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Let it die already jeeeese
23 Sep 2017 19:02:22 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Well I mean exactly, he tried to strongarm me
23 Sep 2017 19:02:38 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, He insulted me, started threatening me with 'i'mma take your staff team' sort of nonsense
23 Sep 2017 19:02:48 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Talked about himself, with no experience mind, as if he was the only one who could salvage this
23 Sep 2017 19:02:48 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, I felt it too, but didnt want to come off as rude. He wanted to lead it himself
23 Sep 2017 19:02:51 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Okie

23 Sep 2017 19:03:19 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, he dm'd me a bit
23 Sep 2017 19:03:21 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, regan ata#3376, Dang it I'm still alive
23 Sep 2017 19:03:28 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, was at work and got distracted wth singleplayer on a new pack I'm trying out
23 Sep 2017 19:03:33 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, So I'm glad for the warning
23 Sep 2017 19:04:13 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, Yeah, and besides. We're loyal to mike and ozi. If they decide that he's a prick, then how can he expect us to help him?
23 Sep 2017 19:04:13 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Oops, let me fix that.
23 Sep 2017 19:04:19 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, RoaringThunder#9046, Wow

23 Sep 2017 19:04:24 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Lieta#9461, It seems like a stupid power grab

23 Sep 2017 19:04:36 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Got a problem with that?
23 Sep 2017 19:04:40 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Absolutely, 100%, that is what he was going for
23 Sep 2017 19:04:41 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, She is my sister.
23 Sep 2017 19:04:42 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, xD
23 Sep 2017 19:04:56 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, RoaringThunder#9046, True my brother would murder me with in seconds xD
23 Sep 2017 19:04:56 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If he had even an ounce of experience I might've just said 'fuck it' and let him have a go
23 Sep 2017 19:05:04 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, regan ata#3376, Yess death XD
23 Sep 2017 19:05:08 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Mr Grrr#1532, good attitude ozi xD
23 Sep 2017 19:05:16 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But I don't want someone like that to carry this forward, I would rather the server go out on its own terms
23 Sep 2017 19:05:26 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, regan ata#3376, Well I'm asking for death XD
23 Sep 2017 19:05:34 : Legacy Craft, selfie, FeedBack#1038, I have more ginger tint than @🐯TIGEᖇ🐅

23 Sep 2017 19:09:48 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Him and hound can go off and do their thing, I doubt it's going to result in anything
23 Sep 2017 19:09:57 : Legacy Craft, selfie, FeedBack#1038, Everyone has a bit of each tint in them

23 Sep 2017 19:42:56 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, royalsfan10#7753, Nah theres no fixing it
23 Sep 2017 19:42:58 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I believe most of the files got corrupted and it spiralled in to 50GB log files for IE, the skyfactory plugin stopped recognising islands, the market plugin fucked itself...
23 Sep 2017 19:42:58 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Plugins broke

23 Sep 2017 19:43:24 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, and why is time an issue?
23 Sep 2017 19:43:28 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, And I tried to keep it up for as long as I could, I spent a few hours on monday or tuesday rebuilding, trying to get them back

23 Sep 2017 19:43:42 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Because the guys who run the server don't have time to do it
23 Sep 2017 19:43:54 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ItzBlaZzze#5611, ozi, was th server made from scratch, or was it brought from a website or something

23 Sep 2017 19:45:22 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, royalsfan10#7753, It was an unfortunate chain of events that couldnt have been prepared for
23 Sep 2017 19:45:37 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I think the thing a few weeks back triggered it
23 Sep 2017 19:45:38 : CrystalFantasy, memememememe, RoaringThunder#9046, 
23 Sep 2017 19:45:39 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, If I knew there was a problem I would have stepped up earlier to help out. Honestly i'm looking for a project to pass time

23 Sep 2017 19:46:08 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Some of us are looking into running new servers with the PGN logo
23 Sep 2017 19:46:28 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, If anyone does, I can redirect the domain, website etc. for you
23 Sep 2017 19:46:30 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Idk if they'll succeed but there's stuff that can be done
23 Sep 2017 19:46:48 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, I don't recall player base being a problem

23 Sep 2017 19:47:47 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, I would love to host a server for PGN but I don’t have the knowledge of running a server through a VS to do so. 😔
23 Sep 2017 19:48:11 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, I can do all back end stuffs, I just have little in java programming  so custom plugins are kinda out

23 Sep 2017 20:00:13 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, "he" and "her" are pronouns.
23 Sep 2017 20:00:27 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Yes, you did.
23 Sep 2017 20:00:34 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, No.
23 Sep 2017 20:00:51 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Well, technically RoaringThunder is right.
23 Sep 2017 20:00:54 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, I'd like the  plugins to look at, Im in school for CIS Programming and interested in seeing how they work.
23 Sep 2017 20:00:58 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, I am Gender Fluid.
23 Sep 2017 20:01:06 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, IF anything practice is practice
23 Sep 2017 20:01:09 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, In terms of jar files, you can grab those from the official sites
23 Sep 2017 20:01:16 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, In terms of configs, they're not really anything special
23 Sep 2017 20:01:22 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, Nothing custom?
23 Sep 2017 20:01:25 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Nope
23 Sep 2017 20:01:31 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, Fair enough
23 Sep 2017 20:01:32 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Hehe, "Re-gan"
23 Sep 2017 20:01:44 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, I despise setting up perms

23 Sep 2017 20:02:24 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, You don't do perms for modpacks
23 Sep 2017 20:02:27 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, You do their config files
23 Sep 2017 20:02:27 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Perms are really esdy

23 Sep 2017 20:03:38 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Please don't.
23 Sep 2017 20:03:39 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No. the forum is hidden
23 Sep 2017 20:03:41 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Danny#8377, Keep us all posted on here tho😂
23 Sep 2017 20:03:43 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, But, vertical chat is fine.
23 Sep 2017 20:03:45 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I can get it for you if you like
23 Sep 2017 20:03:45 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Ah
23 Sep 2017 20:03:50 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Yeah that'd be great
23 Sep 2017 20:03:53 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, 2,000 is the character limit.
23 Sep 2017 20:03:57 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, For which server?
23 Sep 2017 20:03:57 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, ⎛⎝Trip⎠⎞#0877, Yeah 2nd that please
23 Sep 2017 20:03:59 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, That includes spaces.
23 Sep 2017 20:04:01 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, The banned items and blocks for ie

23 Sep 2017 20:04:19 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, If anyone needs a hand figuring out server stuff, I could maybe help too.. helped manage a few servers, mostly solving plugin and mod issues
One of them was a pixelmon server and if you know that mod, you know it usually was a disaster
I'm just a random nub on here though, joined a few days after skyfactory went up xd
23 Sep 2017 20:04:19 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, Nate, I'm going to PM you.

23 Sep 2017 20:05:56 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily☆☆#3763, It's a Discord-wide limit.
23 Sep 2017 20:05:58 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, If you'd like a config file for a particular plugin, I can get that for you possibly
23 Sep 2017 20:06:14 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Just not rn cause I need to go

23 Sep 2017 20:19:17 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, those where good times boii
23 Sep 2017 20:20:12 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, been sitting more at home than at school back then lol
23 Sep 2017 20:21:49 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, SilverRose13#0794, If I knew anything about the plugin side and all I'd offer, but it'd probably be a lot of trial and error that would just make it hard to do I guess
23 Sep 2017 20:23:00 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Yeah, admitedly using those plugins with IE is a new thing for me, Ive ran them on vanilla before, but never thought about combining them
23 Sep 2017 20:23:00 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Alright, everyone who wants to help, DM me please
23 Sep 2017 20:23:17 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, I gotta keep track
23 Sep 2017 20:24:30 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Myeah, interaction between something like griefprevention and mod items is always scary imo
High risk of duping issues and these modpacks are huge
23 Sep 2017 20:26:55 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Yeah, there is a lot to go through, and even if you cleared out anything that could allow duping, it only takes an update or a file restoration to break all of that.
23 Sep 2017 20:27:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TheLast1Alive#7757, Been playing overwatch, some league and some csgo, said fuck mc tbh
23 Sep 2017 20:28:32 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, On the other end though, some of the items that enable it are really useful.
23 Sep 2017 20:32:58 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Mhm, I did like the "report exploits and get rewarded" thing, there's no way the staff can test everything themselves
Some of the smaller things tend to be fixed by global claim flags or a little workaround forge mod
The latter is pretty good for removing recipes for things you don't want people to make
23 Sep 2017 20:34:32 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I would probably also give a bit more thought to how dimensions are used, might have to be a bit more limited on that...
23 Sep 2017 20:35:04 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Dims usually are disabled for good reason
23 Sep 2017 20:35:11 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I don't know why they were allowed in skyfactory, they're pretty much empty
23 Sep 2017 20:35:16 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Pgn had a good system though
23 Sep 2017 20:35:46 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I was thinking about maybe having a single RF dim that would rotate daily
23 Sep 2017 20:36:00 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Don't those dimensions basically cause constant chunk generation lag on normal worlds
23 Sep 2017 20:36:37 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, But trying to limit player interation once they hit a certain point.....
23 Sep 2017 20:36:49 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, A couple at a time arent that bad.
23 Sep 2017 20:37:05 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, but the issue compunds really fast
23 Sep 2017 20:37:11 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, *compounds
23 Sep 2017 20:37:34 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, We could have special events where we open dims for a short time
23 Sep 2017 20:37:45 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Or like you said, a rotating dim
23 Sep 2017 20:37:47 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Based on rank maybe.....
23 Sep 2017 20:38:05 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, But that seems hard to balance
23 Sep 2017 20:38:21 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, It might be good to disable dims entirely
23 Sep 2017 20:38:51 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I would definitely go with a pre-generated world for the overworld, with a world border
Maybe that's just my preference, but I really hate mass chunk generation lol
23 Sep 2017 20:39:01 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Rotating I think would be ok... but would be more work for mods
23 Sep 2017 20:39:11 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Oh....  I had an idea for the world gen
23 Sep 2017 20:39:32 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Lieta#9461, Definitely. Last server I played on had a pregenned world and it is definitely a good idea
23 Sep 2017 20:39:38 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Seen someone merge borders with world edit, making a globe rather than a 2d
23 Sep 2017 20:39:58 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Yeah, once people get really fast, the tps spikes from exploring get bad
23 Sep 2017 20:40:14 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, So there werent really borders, but the map was still limited
23 Sep 2017 20:40:42 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I think the worldborder plugin for bukkit had an option to wrap around the world
The vanilla ones I'm thinking of don't though
23 Sep 2017 20:41:12 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, not that bukkit plugins are relevant, since sponge must be used xd
23 Sep 2017 20:41:57 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ;train
23 Sep 2017 20:41:57 : PokeIslands, bot, Botfuzzy77#2209, 
23 Sep 2017 20:43:03 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, But yeah, put lots of thought into the world stuff, that's good
It'll be a very long term choice
23 Sep 2017 20:43:47 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I would suggest a few weeks of mod only access for server testing purposes.
23 Sep 2017 20:47:19 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, And using MineOS is a pretty easy way to give the more advanced mods access to console, stats and reporting.  Anyone who has ran a hosted server would be familiar with the interface already.
23 Sep 2017 20:48:00 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Also have to keep in mind how you'll do the backups, world size affects how many you can store
I imagine there will need to be a bunch since it sounds kinda volatile lol
23 Sep 2017 20:48:17 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, got the IP yet?
23 Sep 2017 20:48:57 : PokeIslands, general, Legate#1692, still wanna build my home and town Dx
23 Sep 2017 20:49:05 : PokeIslands, general, Legate#1692, but first must transfer items to new world
23 Sep 2017 20:49:16 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Yeah, but you can drop a NAS on the network and not even have to worry about that
23 Sep 2017 20:50:42 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Some ftp access for log files maybe too, I always ran into having the server owner send log files, is slow and annoying
Myeah, depends on the scale you're thinking lol
A 20k x 20k world is about 8-10gb I think, maybe more with mod stuff
23 Sep 2017 20:51:25 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Probably best to find out what each mod knows and is comfortable with and base who can access what on that.
23 Sep 2017 20:53:20 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I can do a lot of debugging on my own, but not being available 24/7 would cause delays again
23 Sep 2017 20:53:46 : Legacy Craft, general, Dormadon#5007, good day

23 Sep 2017 20:55:16 : Legacy Craft, general, Dormadon#5007, ill be back in like 5 minutes, im getting something to eat and checking on something
23 Sep 2017 20:56:49 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, Yeah, some programming experience is great for reading stack dumps in log files and possibly pinpointing issues
Feels kinda silly commenting on this, having only played on here for like a week before it went belly up xd

24 Sep 2017 01:30:45 : PokeIslands, general, 👌🔥 Spuddy 🔥👌#3462, You should make like a time limit for when people good apply cus some people could just have spent 1 hour on it then want to apply
24 Sep 2017 01:30:58 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats why i have /atime check 😉
24 Sep 2017 01:31:23 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, how do i you know actually write on the forums to apply
24 Sep 2017 01:31:52 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, depending on the time they have played i suppose they have knowledge about the mods we use plugins we use and all locations we have on the map 😃
24 Sep 2017 01:32:38 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, what do i do
24 Sep 2017 01:33:10 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, copy this

Why should we take you as a staff member?:

24 Sep 2017 01:33:44 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, then wait
24 Sep 2017 01:34:26 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if you have copied what i gave you press the button which says New Thread

24 Sep 2017 01:34:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, in the title you put your ingame name
24 Sep 2017 01:34:53 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so in your case zppx application

24 Sep 2017 01:39:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i was thinking about a atleast 10 hour play time but i am not sure >_<
24 Sep 2017 01:39:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i don't really think people will be able to know the map in 10 hours
24 Sep 2017 01:39:36 : PokeIslands, general, DaComputerNerd#0914, i think the playtime is a little subjective, really.
24 Sep 2017 01:39:46 : PokeIslands, general, DaComputerNerd#0914, its less playtime and more what you have learned, what you know
24 Sep 2017 01:40:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yeh but depending on the time you have played we asume you have knowledge about the server
24 Sep 2017 01:41:14 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, done and done

24 Sep 2017 08:25:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Adam#7575, in all fairness even when the map last reset there were like....4? people actively playing
24 Sep 2017 08:26:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Adam#7575, but theres nothign left to do except make crazy stuff so id welcome a reset with new mods
24 Sep 2017 08:36:40 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, i really like IE
24 Sep 2017 08:38:23 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I only got to pgn because I wanted to play on a sf3 server
I'm open to try something else though
Bit odd how IE is still 1.7, most mods already updated to 1.10
24 Sep 2017 08:39:27 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, hm? we had the most recent version of IE
24 Sep 2017 08:39:36 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, we always updated whenever a new one came out
24 Sep 2017 08:39:51 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I know, just wondering why the modpack stuck to 1.7
24 Sep 2017 08:41:05 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, but thats nothing we can change, if i understand what you mean^^
24 Sep 2017 08:42:52 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I'm aware xd
Just sounds problematic for bugfixes and plugin updates that happened since then
24 Sep 2017 08:59:35 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Kiery#0229, wtf , im so upset why has the infinity evloved server been shut down , it was the best server for infinity
24 Sep 2017 09:03:32 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, Sorry Kiery, please read the chat. Ozi have explained it multiple times
24 Sep 2017 09:30:59 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Once again though, summarised: Everything imploded, we have no staff with the time to fix it
24 Sep 2017 09:33:22 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Empty Child#5717, modpack stuck to 1.7 cause of a lot of mods
24 Sep 2017 09:33:31 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Empty Child#5717, which were never updated beyond 1.7

24 Sep 2017 10:01:03 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Varijon#2825, I looked at some, yeah.. it seems like half stuck to 1.7 where the other half updated
Very unfortunate, as 1.8 brought some huge performance boosts, like the client only rendering what's visible on screen and separate threads per world

24 Sep 2017 17:15:56 : Legacy Craft, general, Bellosong#1258, When you add sugar n honey to your honey nut cherios
24 Sep 2017 17:17:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if we find a host which provides enough ram for 16,00 USD i'l move but the problem will be -> if i spend the 16$ on the new server with more ram i'l only be able to host for 1 month
24 Sep 2017 17:22:16 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ok so this is the first host i found its 12$ for 1 gig more than we have now

24 Sep 2017 17:33:36 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, yas
24 Sep 2017 17:33:47 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, that is double the current
24 Sep 2017 17:33:51 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, so it shouldn't lag
24 Sep 2017 17:33:59 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well the current is 3 gigs
24 Sep 2017 17:34:02 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, why is the server crashing every 5-10 minutes?
24 Sep 2017 17:34:03 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, I don't understand fully
24 Sep 2017 17:34:11 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, feel like it shouldn't be doing this
24 Sep 2017 17:34:15 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, irisu i am looking into a fix
24 Sep 2017 17:34:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i cant do 4 things at a time
24 Sep 2017 17:34:31 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, i know
24 Sep 2017 17:34:35 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, you've got a lot on your plate
24 Sep 2017 17:34:44 : Legacy Craft, general, Jenna (ButtonBox)#1227, He was trying to steal stuff.
24 Sep 2017 17:34:47 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Oh
24 Sep 2017 17:34:50 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Hi jenna
24 Sep 2017 17:34:54 : Legacy Craft, general, Jenna (ButtonBox)#1227, Hello
24 Sep 2017 17:35:04 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, i just think the most prominent is the crashing every 5-10 minutes, although you're doing something that's very important as well
24 Sep 2017 17:35:07 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, What was he trying to steal????
24 Sep 2017 17:35:09 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, josh petakamu came on a new player and  he wa sin a NPC town that karu built and trying to break stuff and he was very adament about it
24 Sep 2017 17:35:10 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i have to do new spawn + new host + error fixes
24 Sep 2017 17:35:17 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, a possibility josh
24 Sep 2017 17:35:27 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, and break glass
24 Sep 2017 17:35:32 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, mostly the crashes are caused by server ticks
24 Sep 2017 17:35:35 : Legacy Craft, general, EmMiERoSe#7854, Hmm damn
24 Sep 2017 17:35:38 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, yep
24 Sep 2017 17:35:39 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, He was trying to?
24 Sep 2017 17:35:43 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its due the server not having enough ram
24 Sep 2017 17:35:44 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, yes he was josh
24 Sep 2017 17:35:47 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Was he successful?
24 Sep 2017 17:35:49 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, in my stupid and dumb opinion, the priority could be error fixes then new host then new spawn
24 Sep 2017 17:35:50 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, no
24 Sep 2017 17:35:55 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, i followed him
24 Sep 2017 17:36:01 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, or maybe new host/error fixes go hand in hand
24 Sep 2017 17:36:03 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Goos
24 Sep 2017 17:36:06 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Good*
24 Sep 2017 17:36:07 : Legacy Craft, general, EmMiERoSe#7854, I think maybe we should make a default town for New ppl to go to
24 Sep 2017 17:36:10 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, but very adament about it
24 Sep 2017 17:36:22 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, yes we shoudl emmie
24 Sep 2017 17:36:25 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Hmmm
24 Sep 2017 17:36:28 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Good idea
24 Sep 2017 17:36:31 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so for now i have like 16$ if i use these 16$ on a new server then the server is able to run for 1 month
24 Sep 2017 17:36:36 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, I could do that for you emms
24 Sep 2017 17:36:40 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, and even if he does grief or steal it  he will be gone
24 Sep 2017 17:36:46 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, yup yup
24 Sep 2017 17:37:01 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, and excuse my language but i feel that players think we r f'in idiots
24 Sep 2017 17:37:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, which means if i don't find a way to get another 16$ togheter the server could be down for a long time
24 Sep 2017 17:37:11 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, considering pixelmon reborn is gaining traction quick, AND you're on the official server listings, you're definitely gonna get some donators
24 Sep 2017 17:37:17 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Your here in legacy
24 Sep 2017 17:37:21 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, You can swear

24 Sep 2017 17:37:27 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, I'm a CEO as you know
24 Sep 2017 17:37:33 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, And I've gotten tons of shit
24 Sep 2017 17:37:35 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, and with these fixes, it'll make your server a more enjoyable experience so people feel more obliged to donate
24 Sep 2017 17:37:43 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, it's a win win~
24 Sep 2017 17:37:47 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Just for telling one person that they can't do this
24 Sep 2017 17:37:49 : Legacy Craft, general, EmMiERoSe#7854, Lol

24 Sep 2017 17:38:15 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Then he gets his buddies on

But it's an area I made specifiaclly for new people. It has both veggies and meat farms (little) and 3 houses, which I can easily copy and paste more around the island. It also has a mine right underneath it as well as a villager shopping area.

24 Sep 2017 19:36:24 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 16$ a month + -10 coupon = 14$ a month life time
24 Sep 2017 19:36:30 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, Skiddz#6160, *of

24 Sep 2017 19:37:17 : PokeIslands, staff, zppx#1565, hello
24 Sep 2017 19:37:23 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, the annual plan

24 Sep 2017 19:38:26 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, now it'll be even harder for you to keep the server up
24 Sep 2017 19:38:26 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, did you see what i would have to pay from the moment i start the host on the yearly?
24 Sep 2017 19:38:43 : PokeIslands, general, Irisu#6636, 138 dollars?

24 Sep 2017 21:29:11 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its not like mother nature planted a seed somewhere here on earth and 2 peeps grew out off em
24 Sep 2017 21:29:26 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, right
24 Sep 2017 21:29:27 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and fucked each other to grow civilization over the world lol
24 Sep 2017 21:29:33 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, but incest was needed back then
24 Sep 2017 21:29:37 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, now it technically isnt needed
24 Sep 2017 21:29:44 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, this convo is weird
24 Sep 2017 21:29:49 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, ๖̶̶̶ζ͜͡๖ۣۣۜLily#3763, One of these days I'm going to type something in the wrong discord and there will be a lot of people **really** confused.

24 Sep 2017 21:30:02 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, only for close relatives
24 Sep 2017 21:30:06 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, like
24 Sep 2017 21:30:13 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, ur technically related to everyone
24 Sep 2017 21:30:17 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ^
24 Sep 2017 21:30:19 : PokeIslands, staff, Shaggy#1817, Yes
24 Sep 2017 21:30:20 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, but like
24 Sep 2017 21:30:47 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, you are fam whitout even knowing it although alot of things remain in the darknes cause there is no explaination for it
24 Sep 2017 21:30:47 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, its not incest unless you fuck someone more closely related to you
24 Sep 2017 21:31:26 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like where did the first plants come from, where did animals come from and so on and so on lel
24 Sep 2017 21:31:26 : PokeIslands, staff, Shaggy#1817, Correct
24 Sep 2017 21:31:40 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, its not incest if u fuck the girl next door (after you get to know her, marry, be financially stable, and both consent to the intercourse), but it is if you fuck ur sister
24 Sep 2017 21:31:48 : PokeIslands, staff, Shaggy#1817, XD
24 Sep 2017 21:31:55 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, i do not support rape

24 Sep 2017 21:32:12 : PokeIslands, staff, Shaggy#1817, Neither do i
24 Sep 2017 21:32:36 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, and fucking someone closely related just makes it worse for the offspring as bad genes get passed down
24 Sep 2017 21:32:45 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but yeh you don't know if your neighbours is your sister or not no one knows cause sometimes parrents keep a kid as a secret of however you call it
24 Sep 2017 21:32:45 : PokeIslands, staff, Shaggy#1817, Correct
24 Sep 2017 21:33:48 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, So not only must you think about yourself and the person you are fucking, but you also must think about the child thats gonna be conceived.

25 Sep 2017 00:20:39 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, or can it be a command, pokemon, etc.

25 Sep 2017 00:26:17 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, it says Form:
Item:
Tournament points needed to buy:
25 Sep 2017 00:26:42 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, in the donation store commands are seen as items
25 Sep 2017 00:27:28 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so behind Item: you would place the command/item you would like to see in the store
25 Sep 2017 00:27:31 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, but where it says Form: what do i put how hard a question is that
25 Sep 2017 00:27:47 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol its also stated in the post
25 Sep 2017 00:27:56 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, Fill in this form with the item you think should be in the tournament point shop and post it bellow
25 Sep 2017 00:28:24 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, oh i thought i had to put something there lol
25 Sep 2017 00:28:30 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so you just copy the form bellow that
25 Sep 2017 00:28:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, leave Form: alone and fill in the rest
25 Sep 2017 00:28:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, Form is just a title of ta section
25 Sep 2017 00:28:55 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, done and done
25 Sep 2017 00:29:07 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, check if you'd like
25 Sep 2017 00:29:38 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, see if it seems balanced

25 Sep 2017 00:29:49 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, lel
25 Sep 2017 00:30:14 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, also i suggest putting a cool down on the commands
25 Sep 2017 00:30:15 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, it like constantly popping up infront of what i am doing
25 Sep 2017 00:30:19 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and there are lel
25 Sep 2017 00:30:47 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, ok because if there isnt someone could easily spam /Breed and crash or break the server

25 Sep 2017 00:31:19 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 😉 i did that cause of the rank breeder so those with the rank breeder won't be able to abuse it

25 Sep 2017 00:31:56 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lets see if this server is faster 😃
25 Sep 2017 00:33:35 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, could pokemon be considered an item?
25 Sep 2017 00:34:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, euhm i said everything thats in the donation store except ranks 😃
25 Sep 2017 00:34:15 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, so yes then
25 Sep 2017 00:34:55 : PokeIslands, general, zppx#1565, now the real question is should i suggest something or not

25 Sep 2017 04:45:44 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, KitKat°#7820, I can't help myself *brushes it more, feeling your tail wiggle slightly*
25 Sep 2017 04:46:28 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, just be careful its sensitive
25 Sep 2017 04:48:12 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, KitKat°#7820, Yeah I can tell *I softly stroke it as I brush*
25 Sep 2017 04:49:14 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, i don't even remember how long it takes to smoothe them out
25 Sep 2017 04:49:20 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, they get so unruley sometimes
25 Sep 2017 04:55:00 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, KitKat°#7820, Hehe yeah *I keep brushing them more and more, untangling the knots*
25 Sep 2017 04:55:38 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, Why are you giggling so much

25 Sep 2017 05:01:19 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, Hey I only have you 1 why did you have to grab another *says while face is flushed*
25 Sep 2017 05:02:26 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, you know the reason most kitsune brush their own tails right...
25 Sep 2017 05:04:51 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, KitKat°#7820, You only wanted me to brush one? Sorry, might as well do more *brushes your other tail* why's that luv
25 Sep 2017 05:05:38 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, kitsune culture states that whoever touches the females tail get to marry her thats why females are so strong so the males can't touch our tails
25 Sep 2017 05:05:40 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, and
25 Sep 2017 05:05:42 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, also

25 Sep 2017 05:06:24 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, the more tails a kitsune has
25 Sep 2017 05:06:26 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, the stronger
25 Sep 2017 05:06:38 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, i have 9
25 Sep 2017 05:06:45 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, i am one of the strongest...
25 Sep 2017 05:10:21 : CrystalFantasy, sfw-rp, ashley705#9112, this is the culture i was taught

25 Sep 2017 13:13:40 : [RIP] Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, well I guess I should say something about all of this.
I want to say thank you for everyone who enjoyed and played on PGN over the time it was alive and that I got to be apart of a great community with all of you. I will miss doing this but it has simple come down to a matter of time that I unfortunatly don't have. When I first started playing here I had no intentions of becoming staff or doing any of the things I have so it has been a trial by fire for sure. Hopefully you will all remeber playing here as happily as I do. Good luck to you all in the future the world is getting smaller everyday as they say maybe I will see you around it. Well that was as long and rambly as usual but I guess it had some punctation at least!!!
