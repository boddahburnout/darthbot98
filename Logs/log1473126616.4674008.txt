06 Sep 2016 02:51:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Pokken#0986, @Aluxir 1.) Even if a staff was online, between the 100 players in regular chat and the countless using /msg, it is really hard to read or even see a specific message sometimes. If you aren't paying 100% attention to the chat something like that would just fly by and you'd never know. 2.) Staff can not ban for threats of "gliches", if we find out he is using a glitch he will be banned, however, we do not have ANY evidence of him actually having a "glich" except what could be satire or a bluff.

06 Sep 2016 02:54:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Pokken#0986, I also want to point out being a Mod is a lot harder then it looks. You have many more responsibilities than the average player and may not even get to play Pixelmon due to them.

06 Sep 2016 03:06:43 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Luca said he didnt want tags
06 Sep 2016 03:06:52 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, *extra tags
06 Sep 2016 03:06:55 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, *special tags
06 Sep 2016 03:07:06 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, What you're doing is the same thing
06 Sep 2016 03:07:14 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, As adding a permissionless suffix
06 Sep 2016 03:07:16 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, starting download now
06 Sep 2016 03:07:18 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Except it's uglier
06 Sep 2016 03:07:22 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, theres about 3 gbs
06 Sep 2016 03:07:29 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Because Suffix can have a space
06 Sep 2016 03:07:35 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, I think he doesnt want tags to not mess with perms, not for the visuals
06 Sep 2016 03:07:36 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, also server will be beta 7 on new host
06 Sep 2016 03:07:48 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, ik, it would be way more good looking with Suffix
06 Sep 2016 03:08:02 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, suffix is ugly asf
06 Sep 2016 03:08:03 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, But Im not gonna insist on it since luca said no, lol.
06 Sep 2016 03:08:12 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, idk
06 Sep 2016 03:08:17 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, can you have 2 prefixes?
06 Sep 2016 03:08:19 : PassionMC, main-chat, Techni#9903, Lul. Aren't you TiltedPlayer? On mc?
06 Sep 2016 03:08:22 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, we could see how it looks in game first
06 Sep 2016 03:08:25 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, yeah can
06 Sep 2016 03:08:26 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Ideally, we want the tag before the name
06 Sep 2016 03:08:35 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, idk
06 Sep 2016 03:08:36 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, will see
06 Sep 2016 03:08:43 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, We just did it after it to not confuse people with @ .
06 Sep 2016 03:08:46 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, dont want chat very cluttered
06 Sep 2016 03:08:52 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Its 3 characters
06 Sep 2016 03:08:57 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, [] and a letter
06 Sep 2016 03:09:05 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, then maybe
06 Sep 2016 03:09:10 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Maybe 2 letters if more teams get added
06 Sep 2016 03:09:14 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, lol, wanna talk? or going to go figure out something to do

06 Sep 2016 03:10:02 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Better idea
06 Sep 2016 03:10:08 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, The reasoning behind it is that 1. people wont have to visit website everytime they want to see in what team someone belongs two and 2. if a people see many tags in the chat they will start asking questions, thus being informed of the system
06 Sep 2016 03:10:12 : PassionMC, main-chat, ThaOriginal#5897, no
06 Sep 2016 03:10:13 : PassionMC, main-chat, ThaOriginal#5897, who is that
06 Sep 2016 03:10:27 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Change the color of their already existing permission tag [Trainer] to match their team color
06 Sep 2016 03:10:59 : PassionMC, main-chat, Techni#9903, ;n; lul. What's your IGN then?
06 Sep 2016 03:10:59 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Thought of that, but 1 problem is non-trainers and 2nd is that colours may be mixed
06 Sep 2016 03:10:59 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, maybe
06 Sep 2016 03:11:13 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, *confused
06 Sep 2016 03:11:24 : PassionMC, main-chat, ThaOriginal#5897, idk
06 Sep 2016 03:11:47 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I would do small Tags after main rank like [Nerd][CPR] Wertfuzzy77: {Message}
06 Sep 2016 03:11:59 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, ^
06 Sep 2016 03:11:59 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Botfuzzy77#2209, ^
06 Sep 2016 03:12:03 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, where CPR = short for Cipher
06 Sep 2016 03:12:09 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, If there's only 4-5 teams how would you confuse the colors?
06 Sep 2016 03:12:13 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, its is possible but it add so much color to chat
06 Sep 2016 03:12:14 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, We can make do with 1 or 2 letters too
06 Sep 2016 03:12:18 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ^

06 Sep 2016 03:12:33 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, If we did that i rather make then all dull colors
06 Sep 2016 03:13:02 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, people can read fine they dont really need colors to help them too

06 Sep 2016 03:13:36 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, chill
06 Sep 2016 03:13:40 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, It'd only be the "Trainer" bit before their name. And it would be the same 5 colors so it should be too flashy or annoying
06 Sep 2016 03:13:43 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, *talking to don
06 Sep 2016 03:14:05 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, `but 1 problem is non-trainers`
06 Sep 2016 03:14:15 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Having 5 different colors for each rank is a bit too much tho, isnt it
06 Sep 2016 03:14:29 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, Imo yes
06 Sep 2016 03:14:46 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Anyway, no need to discuss that now. If last comes to last (?) we try both in game and choose
06 Sep 2016 03:14:49 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Or how about adding a Symbol somewhere in their Tags?
06 Sep 2016 03:14:58 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, (Is there a last comes to last expression?)
06 Sep 2016 03:15:07 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, worst comes to worst
06 Sep 2016 03:15:12 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but close enough
06 Sep 2016 03:15:15 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, o yeah

06 Sep 2016 03:16:23 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, After some testing in game, gray [] and single colored letter look nice
06 Sep 2016 03:16:34 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Not too flashy
06 Sep 2016 03:16:42 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, oh, true, i single letter tag wouldnt be bad
06 Sep 2016 03:16:42 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, And noticable at the same time
06 Sep 2016 03:16:53 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, My only concern with secondary tags is that the name is going to be super long for some people
06 Sep 2016 03:17:11 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so what are you doing now xD still nothing
06 Sep 2016 03:17:13 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, So [Trainer] [Cock] Wertfuzzy77: Hey

06 Sep 2016 03:17:22 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, That's a looong line of text to say hey
06 Sep 2016 03:17:22 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, I agree. Tags if we use them, have to be like 3 letter frat tags
06 Sep 2016 03:17:29 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, basically
06 Sep 2016 03:17:37 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Right now all we need is 3 letters
06 Sep 2016 03:17:38 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, more like [Nerd][A] Wertfuzzy77:
06 Sep 2016 03:17:47 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, And it gets worse when it's AceTrainer etc
06 Sep 2016 03:17:52 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, For the next addition of teams I can avoid the ones that start with the new letter
06 Sep 2016 03:18:08 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, o, btw
06 Sep 2016 03:18:10 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Since I mentioned it

06 Sep 2016 03:20:51 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, yeah we decided against the alpha and omega names
06 Sep 2016 03:20:52 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Delta is actually lame
06 Sep 2016 03:20:57 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, theyre corny

06 Sep 2016 03:26:22 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so, you want to talk?

06 Sep 2016 03:26:34 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, what about?
06 Sep 2016 03:26:38 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Right but that's like like naming Team Rebirth and Team Harmony Team Heart and Team Soul. It misses the point of the Legendaries just because it's the names of the games.
06 Sep 2016 03:27:01 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, I guess the author went with what sounds better
06 Sep 2016 03:27:19 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, I mean, I myself would have named Giratina's Team Antimatter but it sounded lame
06 Sep 2016 03:27:23 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, So I went for distortion
06 Sep 2016 03:27:27 : PassionMC, main-chat, TROLL#5321, Reading the title, don't give @Mystz ideas

06 Sep 2016 03:28:17 : PassionMC, main-chat, Pugs#3166, this is so sad

06 Sep 2016 03:28:54 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, The nightmare tag would be so long
06 Sep 2016 03:28:56 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, We could do Gray for Darkrai and Black for zekrom I guess
06 Sep 2016 03:28:59 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, But thats in the future
06 Sep 2016 03:29:08 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, It would be an N lol

06 Sep 2016 03:31:01 : PassionMC, staff-chat, Lucario#0401, Players with pretty tags are also. More tempted to stay in server too. So I will keep the in mind. But it has to be balanced and not overwhelming
06 Sep 2016 03:31:02 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, I really hope we get enough players to even test it out
06 Sep 2016 03:31:03 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, mine was pretty good, didnt do much, was just lazy
06 Sep 2016 03:31:11 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, agreed

06 Sep 2016 03:31:42 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, I think it would be a nice prize for the first X teams
06 Sep 2016 03:32:08 : PassionMC, staff-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, Making something boring less boring is usually a great motive

06 Sep 2016 03:39:02 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, that happens, sometimes when people have a bad day, even someone saying hello can seem annoying
06 Sep 2016 03:39:15 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, nothing is wrong with you
06 Sep 2016 03:39:21 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, like i dont want him near me
06 Sep 2016 03:39:33 : PassionMC, main-chat, D3NSH1N#8702, lma

06 Sep 2016 03:40:57 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, maybe you have started to see the world as i do? outside of your own head, gives you a non-subjective view of everything. and maybe you decided that don annoys you?
06 Sep 2016 03:41:38 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, lol i dont want to touch him like a bf anymore
06 Sep 2016 03:41:50 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, it makes me feel bad now
06 Sep 2016 03:42:39 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so maybe you getting annoyed is your body's way of trying to move on? or trying to adjust to the fact that you cant love 2 people? so it is compensating by pushing one away?

06 Sep 2016 03:43:35 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, that has to be difficult for you tho, seeing someone you used to love and getting annoyed at just being near them
06 Sep 2016 03:44:24 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, idk. its like my mind wants him to break up with me lo
06 Sep 2016 03:44:59 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, hmm, your mind is clever
06 Sep 2016 03:45:14 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Yep

06 Sep 2016 03:45:31 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it decided that the best course of action is to try to make him break up with you, so you dont have to be heart broken breaking up with him

06 Sep 2016 03:49:14 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, that would be best for both of you tho, drifting apart instead of shattering, you wouldnt feel bad for breaking his heart, and he wouldnt feel terrible, he might even gradually understand that you really arent interested and try to move on
06 Sep 2016 03:49:32 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, i hope so

06 Sep 2016 03:55:37 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, i hope so
06 Sep 2016 03:56:00 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Yeah Cresselia is Good Dreams and Darkrai is Nightmares
06 Sep 2016 03:56:09 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, So it'd be Teams Dreams and Nightmares
06 Sep 2016 03:56:29 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, thats why those care packages may save my life
06 Sep 2016 03:56:40 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, si, i thought that was a good idea
06 Sep 2016 03:56:45 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, There should be a word for Good Dreams
06 Sep 2016 03:56:59 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I've been actually thinking about that for a while xD but never really had a chance to bring it up
06 Sep 2016 03:57:03 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Closest thing I know of in English is Fantasy and it has connotations that make it unclear
06 Sep 2016 03:57:12 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, interesting
06 Sep 2016 03:57:39 : PassionMC, staff-chat, DonTheBreton#0276, Reverie is an okay option but it implies daydreaming
06 Sep 2016 03:57:57 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Thats how i work tho xD i save things in my head, and say them when i think it is best
06 Sep 2016 03:58:02 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, or when i think you want to hear them
06 Sep 2016 03:59:15 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, well its a great idea
