18 Nov 2016 03:42:49 : The Wild Weebs, general, enragednuke#2565, it also heavily favors popular series
18 Nov 2016 03:42:58 : The Wild Weebs, general, enragednuke#2565, like how clannad could have 50 kanon recommendations
18 Nov 2016 03:43:06 : The Wild Weebs, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, but it only counts it once
18 Nov 2016 03:43:21 : The Wild Weebs, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it counts the 10 most recommended animes per anime you have watched
18 Nov 2016 03:43:39 : The Wild Weebs, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, multiplies them by the rating you gave the anime you watched, and adds it to a list
18 Nov 2016 03:43:43 : The Wild Weebs, general, enragednuke#2565, but that what if there's  bunch of the same anime onlyy recommended once 🤔

20 Nov 2016 23:23:26 : The Wild Weebs, coding, enragednuke#2565, idk anything about serialization lol
20 Nov 2016 23:23:38 : The Wild Weebs, coding, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ```Question 1.
6

Question 2.
A Starts with $400
B Starts with $600
First Second Third = <Operation> -> <Operation> -> <Final_Outcome>
T1 T2 T3 = (500, 600) -> (400, 700) -> (440, 770)
T1 T3 T2 = (500, 600) -> (550, 660) -> (450, 760)
T2 T1 T3 = (300, 700) -> (400, 700) -> (440, 770)
T2 T3 T1 = (300, 700) -> (330, 770) -> (430, 770)
T3 T2 T1 = (440, 660) -> (340, 760) -> (440, 760)
T3 T1 T2 = (440, 660) -> (540, 660) -> (440, 760)

Question 3.
4

Question 4.
T1 T2 T3 and T2 T1 T3

T3 T2 T1 and T3 T1 T2

Both of these are in a similar situation where the only difference in the pairs is that T1 and T2 are flipped in their order. This makes sense, because it doesnt matter whether you add 100 to A then transfer, or transfer then add 100, in both cases A has a net loss of 0, and B gains $100.

Question 5.
The best order to Maximize the sum of values in the accounts would be either T1 T2 T3 or T2 T1 T3.

Question 6.
(400, 600)
T1 Start
T1 - A + 100 (500, 600)
T1 Complete
T2 Start
T2 - B + 100 (500, 700)
T3 Start
T3 - A * 1.1 (550, 700)
T3 - B * 1.1 (550, 770)
T3 Complete
T2 - A - 100 (450, 770)
T2 Complete

Sum is $10 more than that of the maximized serial Schedule.

Question 7.
(400, 600)
T2 Start
T2 - B + 100 (400, 700)
T2 - A - 100 (300, 700)
T2 Complete
T3 Start
T3 - A * 1.1 (330, 700)
T1 Start
T1 - A + 100 (430, 700)
T1 Complete
T3 - B * 1.1 (430, 770)
T3 Complete

This is Equivilent to the T2 T3 T1 Order.

Question 8.
R1(A), W1(A), R2(B), W2(B), R3(A), W3(A), R3(B), W3(B), R2(A), W2(A)
1 -> 3 (W1(A) -> R3(A))
2 -> 3 (W2(B) -> R3(B))
3 -> 2 (W3(A) -> R2(A))
1 -> 2 (W1(A) -> R2(A))

This has a cycle, 2 -> 3 and 3 -> 2, so it is not conflict serializable.

Question 9.
R2(B), W2(B), R2(A), W2(A), R3(A), W3(A), R1(A), W1(A), R3(B), W3(B)
This has no cycles, so it is conflict serializable.

28 Nov 2016 21:04:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, cause they just did a normal update with LLAMAS
28 Nov 2016 21:11:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, weebs
28 Nov 2016 21:12:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, lightning + anime = weeaboo
28 Nov 2016 21:12:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, le? anime? where does anime come into this
28 Nov 2016 21:12:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Joey#5933, lol
28 Nov 2016 21:13:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, last i checked my name had nothing to do with an anime
28 Nov 2016 21:13:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, my name is only abrviated from sensei lesbians
28 Nov 2016 21:13:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, weeb confirmed
28 Nov 2016 21:13:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, cause DicloniusPony sensei of Lesbians would be too long of a name X3
28 Nov 2016 21:14:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, japanese people cant be weebs tho X3
28 Nov 2016 21:14:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, incorrect
28 Nov 2016 21:14:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, its the logic
28 Nov 2016 21:14:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, they are the master race of weeb
28 Nov 2016 21:14:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, ohmilord
28 Nov 2016 21:14:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, we got the weeb culture from you guys and all the anime
28 Nov 2016 21:14:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, but weeaboos are people who want to be japanese and try acting like it
28 Nov 2016 21:14:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, someone who is japanese cant be a weeaboo but a otaku.
28 Nov 2016 21:15:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, i think i'll just stick with being british :L
28 Nov 2016 21:15:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, DicloniusPony Senpai Of Yuri#6564, and saying otaku in japan well... is very disrepectful and if that person is your friend you said that to, well no more friend X3
