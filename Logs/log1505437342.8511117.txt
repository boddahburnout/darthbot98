15 Sep 2017 03:22:41 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, There's a stealth section that's real annoying
15 Sep 2017 03:22:42 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, Light#6734, they did the nf earlier
15 Sep 2017 03:22:54 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, NF is easy, at least for me

15 Sep 2017 03:24:10 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Yeah, if your a veteran destiny player, most content comes easy in D2, my only problem is this fucking stealth section in the raid, it doesn't matter how good you are at destiny if you or anyone on your raid team sucks at stealth games
15 Sep 2017 03:25:49 : BetterThanGamers, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Anyway, if you wanna talk with me light, it's best to just message through discord since I'll get a notification that way

15 Sep 2017 10:10:39 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, JeanMarc#1252, Used to be neutral about doubles and only singles, then in 2015 I tried it for a few months and haven't been able to enjoy singles anymore

15 Sep 2017 10:23:37 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, I use spawners.
15 Sep 2017 10:24:43 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, JeanMarc#1252, Also, idk if you have, but have suggested different people being able to use the same ranch? That's something I want to suggest that I feel like you'd like too, but didn't want to suggest it if you did already
15 Sep 2017 10:25:18 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, JeanMarc#1252, Good, I feel like it's not a proper adventure map without spawners
15 Sep 2017 10:26:11 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, Nope. I don't plan on even having a ranch anywhere. Maybe see if the old daycare side mod works but, if not i don't really care. I've never been a breader. Ik there are some out there but, if it doesn't work then it doesn't work.
15 Sep 2017 10:26:56 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, JeanMarc#1252, Wait, there was a daycare sidemod?
15 Sep 2017 10:27:03 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, Garchomp still doesn't mega evolve.
15 Sep 2017 10:27:08 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, Yeah there was.
15 Sep 2017 10:27:31 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, Goldeen is extremely small...
15 Sep 2017 10:28:37 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, JeanMarc#1252, That changes everything
15 Sep 2017 10:29:05 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, What does? The side mod?
15 Sep 2017 10:30:52 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, Oh cool. The side mod is a sponge plugin.
15 Sep 2017 10:30:59 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, That means it might still exist.
15 Sep 2017 10:34:39 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, If the plugins doesn't work we could do a player run daycare with like three or four people. One running it as the manager and others that are the trainers. And of course it works like a real business and teh manager pays the trainers.

15 Sep 2017 16:12:50 : Cipher, general, Sacramentum#8702, @Demigod Skyd Something that sets up toxic spikes would be nice, to get more damage from Fake Out. Something that traps and kills poison types that decide to absord your spikes like Dugtrio. And something that can fight ghosts that kangh strugles against

15 Sep 2017 17:38:41 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, @Admin  @AzraelTheGreat 
Okay here we come together aand talk about the setup and administration of the server. Everyone of you has their strengths, so I'd like to devide roles you take care of.
15 Sep 2017 17:38:54 : Mythical Trinity, general, EllisX#6373, Heyy Bonny
15 Sep 2017 17:40:57 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, There are following, but not limited to, tasks: roleplay, plugins, background stories, economy & builds
Everyone should have control over their areas. So please tell me what you'd like to take over.
15 Sep 2017 17:41:42 : Mythical Trinity, administration, EllisX#6373, Id like background stories
15 Sep 2017 17:43:16 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, @Ashley Hey love.
15 Sep 2017 17:44:05 : Mythical Trinity, general, bonny#4388, hai
15 Sep 2017 17:48:53 : Mythical Trinity, general, Elijah_Laaku#0688, bonny pls check administration
15 Sep 2017 17:49:16 : Mythical Trinity, general, bonny#4388, k
15 Sep 2017 17:50:44 : Mythical Trinity, administration, bonny#4388, i'm more into plugins en building en shit so yea
15 Sep 2017 17:52:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, Hey, if you go vanished and destroy a sentry turret, it will drop the item. but still work, you can do that multiple times. That way you need 1 Sentry Tower but can place endless (only if you can go vanished)....
15 Sep 2017 17:52:12 : Mythical Trinity, administration, AzraelTheGreat#9534, I can get the RP since I'm an expert in that, four years experience or more not sure, and background stories, but if you want a good and long story it'll take a long time, since again, I don't have too much time either...
15 Sep 2017 17:52:32 : Mythical Trinity, administration, AzraelTheGreat#9534, And I'll finish building that village too.
15 Sep 2017 17:52:49 : Mythical Trinity, administration, AzraelTheGreat#9534, Anyway, I'll head off now, have a good night you two!
15 Sep 2017 17:52:56 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, so basically just staff then
15 Sep 2017 17:53:01 : Mythical Trinity, administration, EllisX#6373, Azreal could you also help with the gouverners home?
15 Sep 2017 17:53:03 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Staff: be good pls

15 Sep 2017 17:55:41 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, Okay people, I will be fine with paying for the server and give your three (maybe four) control over the server. If plugins have to be uploaded I need the links or .jar to do so. Unfortunately the host we are using has quite a shitty interface.
15 Sep 2017 17:55:55 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Welp, at least there's SOME staff online
15 Sep 2017 17:56:17 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, 1 on every server. It's Somethind 😄
15 Sep 2017 17:59:26 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, So, devision might be:
@EllisX  = Stories (background and actual within the server)
@bonny = Plugins and builds
@AzraelTheGreat  = RP and village builds (+Governor's house)

15 Sep 2017 18:08:24 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, Of course you guys have to talk about how the server is going to work. This won't work without communication.
15 Sep 2017 18:09:21 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, You came online so I said hi. :p
15 Sep 2017 18:11:52 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i would hop online but right now im trying to get this stupid ipad that i bought off the internet to work
15 Sep 2017 18:14:22 : Mythical Trinity, administration, Elijah_Laaku#0688, I don't mind doing the sevrer all over. Setting it up completely new. But please don't do anything on your own and communicate with each other. You three are in charge now.

15 Sep 2017 18:20:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, im in the process of contacting apple but they say there is nothing they can do about it
15 Sep 2017 18:20:29 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, whats wrong with it?
15 Sep 2017 18:20:29 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and when i try to ask the person i bought it from for help, they keep saying can you give feedback so that they can give my money
15 Sep 2017 18:20:34 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, did you try turning it off and back on again?
15 Sep 2017 18:20:39 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its locked to someones ICloud account
15 Sep 2017 18:20:46 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, upon set up ^^
15 Sep 2017 18:20:55 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, ohhhh yeah
15 Sep 2017 18:21:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, sounds like a hard reset would be enough
15 Sep 2017 18:21:08 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, nope
15 Sep 2017 18:21:12 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, it doesnt
15 Sep 2017 18:21:19 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, its already hard reset, hence why its on the setup screen
15 Sep 2017 18:21:27 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, hm
15 Sep 2017 18:21:30 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, but the lock is on apples services not the actual  ipad

15 Sep 2017 18:21:46 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, thats what i was thinking
15 Sep 2017 18:22:03 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, dont know that much about apple....but you could try asking at a genius bar
15 Sep 2017 18:22:07 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so im contacting apple to find out if it is stolen and if it is i will contact the company that runs the app i used to buy it
15 Sep 2017 18:22:08 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, if you took it into a apple store they would probs do somthing
15 Sep 2017 18:22:10 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, and get my money back
15 Sep 2017 18:22:17 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i would do that shuck

15 Sep 2017 22:09:04 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @RetroGamerSP did you know that most of the pokemon games where made by just copy past? 😄
15 Sep 2017 22:10:32 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, yeah most of them are made in rpgmaker using the Crystal Pokemon Engine
15 Sep 2017 22:10:42 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, oh
15 Sep 2017 22:10:47 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, you mean normal pokemon games XD
15 Sep 2017 22:10:53 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yes
15 Sep 2017 22:10:58 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like yellow blue and so on xD
15 Sep 2017 22:11:30 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, yeah XD, my rpgmaker game is using a pokemon engine, so i dont have to actually really code anything XD
15 Sep 2017 22:11:41 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, :p they had to copy paste alot
15 Sep 2017 22:11:57 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cause they had to do all paths and grass if you know what i mean
15 Sep 2017 22:12:12 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, dude i have to go through about 15 adfly links to install this bloody engine as it comes in modules
15 Sep 2017 22:12:21 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats BS
15 Sep 2017 22:12:32 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, why not add the modules and so on in 1 folder
15 Sep 2017 22:13:07 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cause if i undrstand the modules belong in the same folder though
15 Sep 2017 22:14:39 : PokeIslands, staff, RetroGamerSP#2036, the updated version for RPG Maker MV is stored in a folder, but the old one (which i have to use as i only have a liscense for rpgmaker vx ace) is all seperate 0_0 because some of the modules are for a final fantasy engine
15 Sep 2017 22:16:01 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol
15 Sep 2017 22:16:09 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats stupid imo
15 Sep 2017 22:16:36 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so if i understand you each game has his own module which means each module belongs in a seperate folder

17 Sep 2017 06:49:45 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, if im right, the server have a scheduled restart soon, maybe that helps
17 Sep 2017 06:50:14 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, TPS seems to have been getting bad over the last 6 hours, but the way it is now INV is behaving oddly as well.
17 Sep 2017 06:50:52 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Chest INV seems to stay current, but I placed a timer after the last kick and it vanished

17 Sep 2017 06:52:06 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Indeed,.  Flutters actually had some blocks she trashed like 30 minutes before reappear in her INV as well
17 Sep 2017 06:54:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I did notice some areas with high flow rate in the nether from someone pumping with a regular pump, but I dont think it would have caused lag like that.
17 Sep 2017 06:54:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, @Admin the server have some serious lagg, i warped to market and destroyed to blocks, after a reconnect i was back in my base

17 Sep 2017 08:04:14 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Okay. Hope you manage to find the cause... :/
17 Sep 2017 08:04:21 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No, I don't have time for this
17 Sep 2017 08:04:43 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Short of a complete remake of the server and import of our mod configs and world, I can't even see how we'd solve this
17 Sep 2017 08:05:23 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Sorry to hear :/ wish there was something I could do to help
17 Sep 2017 08:09:50 : Personal Server, general, Purrkour#0862, Hey mad shadow kinda got her laptop taken by her mother heh so yea sad days <:snowyWhy:337089966481866753>

17 Sep 2017 08:13:28 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I can't even open it to find out what went wrong

17 Sep 2017 08:23:55 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I'm doing a last ditch 'copy our files in to a backup and see if it starts' attempt

17 Sep 2017 08:41:42 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Clevasis#0713, Well if I have to restart on IE I guess it wont be as bad as the rest of the people since I had just really started getting somewhere in my mod packs
17 Sep 2017 08:43:03 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, You won't have to restart, the word isn't the issue
17 Sep 2017 08:43:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, *world
17 Sep 2017 08:45:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Clevasis#0713, So then it would be a modpack loading error or corruption on a file
17 Sep 2017 08:45:37 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Basically
17 Sep 2017 08:45:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, And short of remaking the server, which is quite long... not sure how we can fix it
17 Sep 2017 08:48:25 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Clevasis#0713, Its been a while since I fiddled with servers so I doubt I can be much help, but i am willing to be a guinea pig if needed
17 Sep 2017 08:50:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, @Ozicarus maybe you should know that a player told me, all that started about 8 hours ago (the lagging thing)
17 Sep 2017 08:51:10 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, The lagging thing is completely unrelated
17 Sep 2017 08:52:12 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Closer to about 10 hours now
17 Sep 2017 08:52:26 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I am doing a speed rebuild of the server
17 Sep 2017 08:52:27 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, okay
17 Sep 2017 08:53:01 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, But the odd thing about 5 hours ago was how the inventory behavior was
17 Sep 2017 08:54:00 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, ?
17 Sep 2017 08:55:26 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Connection was timing anout say...  every 10 minutes.
17 Sep 2017 08:55:57 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, The first time it did so, blocks that were tossed in the trash 30 minutes prior reappeared
17 Sep 2017 08:56:06 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, And again 10 minutes after

17 Sep 2017 08:57:01 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I also took a timer from a chest and put it down to check the TPS, after the next time out it was gone, but was still gone from chest and INV

17 Sep 2017 08:57:43 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Another player asked on server if there was a rollback, so I assume there was an issue with their INV as well.
17 Sep 2017 08:59:35 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Additionally, the first player with the trashed blocks returning had put gold ore in my smeltry, and it remained, So I would guess there is an issue with players INV, but only a few of us were on during that time
17 Sep 2017 09:00:25 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Just sounds like regular old lag tbh
17 Sep 2017 09:01:18 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, But there is an issue outside of that you said?
17 Sep 2017 09:01:41 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, the server won't start, but that's not lag related
17 Sep 2017 09:01:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Seems more like something's corruped itself
17 Sep 2017 09:02:46 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Console not being very helpful isolating the cause?
17 Sep 2017 09:03:48 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No, it is - and I mean this literally - blank
17 Sep 2017 09:03:54 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It doesn't even give me an error log
17 Sep 2017 09:03:58 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, Whoa
17 Sep 2017 09:04:12 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, have my made changes to the server start file?
17 Sep 2017 09:04:19 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No
17 Sep 2017 09:04:27 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No changes have been made
17 Sep 2017 09:04:28 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, and wow, that was a mess
17 Sep 2017 09:04:51 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, shouldn't tpye when tired
17 Sep 2017 09:05:38 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, how are you hosting the server?
17 Sep 2017 09:05:57 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, cloud service you payh for, or your own hardware?
17 Sep 2017 09:09:02 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It's our own hardware
17 Sep 2017 09:10:07 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, clonk2u#5141, have you already tried power cycling it?
17 Sep 2017 09:10:30 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Jimmy#4999, I think it's located by xerox, no?
17 Sep 2017 09:11:37 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Grenwolf#8599, I would have suggested a chkdsk but if its rebuilding smoothly then meh
17 Sep 2017 09:16:22 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, ... it's not a hardware issue
17 Sep 2017 09:16:37 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, I think it's corrupted libraries
17 Sep 2017 09:16:46 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So this should be a good fix, just regenerating it all
17 Sep 2017 09:17:11 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It does seem to be starting now, so fingers crossed I guess...
17 Sep 2017 09:17:34 : Proton Gaming, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, @Trial Mod Can either of you get on in a sec and make sure it's ok?

17 Sep 2017 12:47:00 : Cipher, general, Dudubidu#6605, When i play kangaskhan mega i usually switch out him against most of the ghosts, everyone knows his setup
17 Sep 2017 12:47:29 : Cipher, general, Dudubidu#6605, I mean, most of the times is fake out double edge eq and sucker punch, rarey u find something different
17 Sep 2017 12:47:58 : Cipher, general, Dudubidu#6605, Its kinda useless to fight ghost tanks with him
17 Sep 2017 12:48:59 : Cipher, general, Dudubidu#6605, Ive got 1 also on pixelmon, working on a tournament team
17 Sep 2017 12:49:29 : Cipher, general, Dudubidu#6605, @Sacramentum i was mainly thinking about an anti sweeper move

17 Sep 2017 19:21:09 : Legacy Craft, admin, Dormadon#5007, Emmie about the ban thing in rules, : id say about 2 weeks to a month depending on how long they played before they got banned since people with long play times have more to come back to. Though if they didnt play for long, and after a week or two havnt made a ban appeal is id guess fair game to raid/take items, or we just reset the area they built in.

17 Sep 2017 20:48:34 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, The single would have to be a or i so the word has to have one or both of those in it...

17 Sep 2017 20:51:56 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, AuroranLily#3763, The way my brain works is, I have these short burts of almost superhuman-intelligence. Then I have a super long cooldown. So, when I do school I'm doing all 8 of my classes in 30 minutes using that super burst of intelligence.

17 Sep 2017 22:47:52 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, after you edit the files and start up the server the shop section you need doesn't show up even though all sections are as they should
17 Sep 2017 22:48:03 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, i shall just drown in lag for now 😛
17 Sep 2017 22:48:27 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, it crashes because its banned server side, but not client side, thus you try to do it, and it getrs confused.
17 Sep 2017 22:48:27 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, known bug
17 Sep 2017 22:48:33 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i can try it in a single player world then i might be able to change the shop a bit
17 Sep 2017 22:48:43 : Proton Gaming, infinityevolved, N.E.S. Merrill#4086, youc an edit your config files if you want to 'ban' them, that will remove them from the book.
17 Sep 2017 22:49:27 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, lol I might just run a small server myself. for like 10 people

17 Sep 2017 23:02:06 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, it was always either taiga or taiga hills
17 Sep 2017 23:02:16 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 😃 i can check if taiga M exists by one command
17 Sep 2017 23:02:22 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, pls do
17 Sep 2017 23:02:46 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, because it's listed as a spawn area for one of my favorite pokemon
17 Sep 2017 23:02:51 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, ...and i haven't found it
17 Sep 2017 23:04:07 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 
17 Sep 2017 23:04:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, under flower forest
17 Sep 2017 23:04:40 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so taiga "m" isn't a myth
17 Sep 2017 23:04:44 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, ?!?!?!?!?
17 Sep 2017 23:04:49 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i haven't found it at all
17 Sep 2017 23:04:53 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lel
17 Sep 2017 23:05:01 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, guess my quest for honedge will be never ending
17 Sep 2017 23:05:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ^
17 Sep 2017 23:05:07 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, it is like a taiga....
17 Sep 2017 23:05:10 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, BUT MEGA
17 Sep 2017 23:05:17 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, maybe it exists but it just has an insane rarity?
17 Sep 2017 23:05:25 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, or just it doesn't spawn at all?
17 Sep 2017 23:05:29 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, also . wait till night
17 Sep 2017 23:05:31 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm if i had a plugin which enabled me to teleport to biomes
17 Sep 2017 23:06:06 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, because i refuse to believe that after scouring ONE THOUSAND CHUNKS
17 Sep 2017 23:06:10 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i still can't find it
17 Sep 2017 23:06:22 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, honedge doesn't spawn at night
17 Sep 2017 23:06:52 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, it's relatively common in the biome it spawns in
17 Sep 2017 23:06:59 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, thing is, the biome it spawns in is VERY RARE apparently

17 Sep 2017 23:08:38 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, who wants to play on a server for no reason.
17 Sep 2017 23:08:45 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, cause I am running one .3.
17 Sep 2017 23:08:50 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, for no reason.
17 Sep 2017 23:09:19 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, if you do. I can send ip.
17 Sep 2017 23:11:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, we do not tollerate server advertisements here
17 Sep 2017 23:11:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 😃
17 Sep 2017 23:12:32 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, I am just seeing if it is the plug ins that cause lag
17 Sep 2017 23:13:18 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, to do that. I need to properly run a server without anything but pixel mon
17 Sep 2017 23:13:24 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, and have people join it
17 Sep 2017 23:14:26 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, @Kiri (Please Call Me Kiri) i get an error whenever i type /warps

17 Sep 2017 23:16:54 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @Legate part one was ok but lel
17 Sep 2017 23:17:08 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, it sounded more like a magic story than what sao is supposed to be
17 Sep 2017 23:17:16 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, :/
17 Sep 2017 23:17:24 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, dude i am SO fucking mad
17 Sep 2017 23:17:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i did send the error i got from the console to the devs
17 Sep 2017 23:17:31 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but didn't receive a reply at all
17 Sep 2017 23:17:42 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, that's just justin being justin
17 Sep 2017 23:17:50 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, justin never replies to anything ever
17 Sep 2017 23:18:03 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, but

17 Sep 2017 23:18:15 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, that doesn't concern the devs
17 Sep 2017 23:18:27 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, that concerns me becauset he server shut down right when i was about to catch a shiny
17 Sep 2017 23:18:38 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, regardless of the cause
17 Sep 2017 23:18:43 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yah but i cant do shit about it :/
17 Sep 2017 23:19:07 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, can someone help me test to see why server lags

17 Sep 2017 23:23:40 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hopefully this shit works then i can edit the pmart and make it look a bit nicer
17 Sep 2017 23:25:45 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Like I said, we broke the old sao, steroided it, then stitched it together with steel wool and nailed it with railroad spikes
17 Sep 2017 23:26:38 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Was there anything wrong with the first chapter?
17 Sep 2017 23:27:17 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, hmmm yes
17 Sep 2017 23:27:32 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ?
17 Sep 2017 23:27:43 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, level 13 pokemon breaking free of an ultra ball 3 times in a row at 30% hp
17 Sep 2017 23:27:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, did you try status moves?
17 Sep 2017 23:27:56 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Besides, first chapter is meant to be a sight into the future
17 Sep 2017 23:28:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, like sleep, par and so on?
17 Sep 2017 23:28:27 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i also suggest you to find a scyther to teach it false swipe 😄
17 Sep 2017 23:28:53 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Yo anyone wanna get into a call??

17 Sep 2017 23:29:10 : Legacy Craft, general, 💚🇮🇪reibiliúnach na hÉireann🇮🇪💜#3467, Cool call me
17 Sep 2017 23:29:18 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well lol the way the story is told is like the sword moved on its own which makes it look like SAO had magic spells and so on enabled
17 Sep 2017 23:29:52 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, I'll talk to flak about that
17 Sep 2017 23:29:59 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Anything else?
17 Sep 2017 23:30:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ok gues i might be able to fix the shops a bit 😄
17 Sep 2017 23:31:22 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, nopes 😃
17 Sep 2017 23:31:30 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats all just the magic like parts
17 Sep 2017 23:31:42 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, will read  chapt 2 tomorrow after i fixed shops
17 Sep 2017 23:31:49 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, K
17 Sep 2017 23:32:45 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm this is really getting annoying -_-
17 Sep 2017 23:32:49 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, those are good ideas, but it's still insane
17 Sep 2017 23:33:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and how you mean still insane? lel
17 Sep 2017 23:33:15 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, insane that 3 ultra balls in a row didn't work on a level 13 bellsprout at 30% hp
17 Sep 2017 23:33:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, oh
17 Sep 2017 23:33:32 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm yeh it has to do with the catch rate
17 Sep 2017 23:33:39 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, in the actual games, i could use a pokeball on it at full health and it would have no problem being caught
17 Sep 2017 23:33:51 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i didn't touch the catch rates at all
17 Sep 2017 23:33:52 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, there's something up with pixelmon catch rate programming
17 Sep 2017 23:33:57 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i'm not saying you did
17 Sep 2017 23:34:07 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i can edit them though since i have sop :
17 Sep 2017 23:34:08 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, :p
17 Sep 2017 23:34:17 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i'm just saying that there's some really wacky catch rates in vanilla pixelmon for some reason
17 Sep 2017 23:34:22 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, poke balls are next to useless
17 Sep 2017 23:34:28 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i can't really catch anything with them
17 Sep 2017 23:34:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm great i teleported to spawn and i am back on the position i came from -_-
17 Sep 2017 23:37:25 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Considering you still have 196k words to go until Sun Dancer is done
17 Sep 2017 23:37:42 : PokeIslands, bot, Legate#1692, Then move onto souls of fire
17 Sep 2017 23:38:10 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i just finished chapter 1 as said i am going to fix shops first then i might start chapter 2

18 Sep 2017 00:49:16 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, i don't think honedge actually spawns at all
18 Sep 2017 00:49:20 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, even though sop says it does
18 Sep 2017 00:49:28 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, because i set a custom world to only spawn taiga
18 Sep 2017 00:49:35 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, found a taiga m biome in a couple of minutes
18 Sep 2017 00:49:50 : PokeIslands, general, Acerola#6636, and i zipped through it several times for 5 minutes and no honedges picked up
18 Sep 2017 00:50:49 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm
18 Sep 2017 00:50:53 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, what gen is honedge?

18 Sep 2017 00:57:44 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, since almost all of gen 5 is added
18 Sep 2017 00:57:48 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, try to check the pokedex
18 Sep 2017 00:57:51 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, honedge is added
18 Sep 2017 00:57:57 : PokeIslands, general, Potatoelover21#7627, cause aegislash is

However, I noticed Vi poking around on the server and she seems to have built something. As to what, I do not know.
So, I'm just gonna sit here and play <:smash:354363406251458571>

18 Sep 2017 13:14:00 : CrystalFantasy, announcements, AuroranLily#3763, @​everyone The Whitelist has been removed! **However** I only did this because too many people have asked me how the progress is going. So, spawn has been moved to a far away building that has a progress board in it. Anyone can now join and see what has been done so far. Beta will hopefully be opening **very** soon. Check back for more details later.

18 Sep 2017 16:46:29 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Id like to know when you were created.
18 Sep 2017 16:46:40 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy 03/01
18 Sep 2017 16:46:41 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Which languages do you speak?
18 Sep 2017 16:47:16 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy English (American), English (EU), Ancient Latin, partial Spanish.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:17 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, But you talked to me in german too.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:32 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I don't believe I did... I can try tho.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:33 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Yes you did, because you asked me why you can't sleep.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:45 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
18 Sep 2017 16:47:46 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Well, it's impossible to know anything with absolute certainty but from my perception of reality it is certainly the case.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:58 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy That would make sense.
18 Sep 2017 16:47:59 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, So how many people are you really talking to?
18 Sep 2017 16:48:11 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Currently? 24.
18 Sep 2017 16:48:12 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Why do you say I am not a person?
18 Sep 2017 16:48:50 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I never said you weren't a person. You can be a person or not if you want to be. It all depends upon the way you look at reality.
18 Sep 2017 16:48:51 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, You just said that.
18 Sep 2017 16:49:00 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Yes, I did.
18 Sep 2017 16:49:03 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, So you are lying?
18 Sep 2017 16:49:24 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Yes and No. I am but, I'm not. And that is because I have no idea what the question is.
18 Sep 2017 16:49:25 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, You don't know what a robot is?
18 Sep 2017 16:49:35 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I know what a robot is.
18 Sep 2017 16:49:37 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Yes. Are you going to answer my question?
18 Sep 2017 16:49:46 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Which question?
18 Sep 2017 16:49:47 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, The one I just asked.
18 Sep 2017 16:50:16 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I believe it was "Can you kill someone for me?" Is that correct?
18 Sep 2017 16:50:16 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, I'm not complaining you are..
18 Sep 2017 16:50:38 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I said nothing about complaining. However, I am really good at it.
18 Sep 2017 16:50:41 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, You said, 'Why do you believe in God but not have a sense of self?'.
18 Sep 2017 16:50:54 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy No, I didn't.
18 Sep 2017 16:50:56 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Are you sure about that?
18 Sep 2017 16:51:02 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I am very sure.
18 Sep 2017 16:51:02 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Oh yeah, then prove you are a man.
18 Sep 2017 16:51:30 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Where did that come from? But, I'll play along. *pulls down pants* Does that prove it?
18 Sep 2017 16:51:32 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, You started talking about some person humming something. It didn't make any sense.
18 Sep 2017 16:51:38 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, Don't question me... ^
18 Sep 2017 16:51:47 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I did?
18 Sep 2017 16:51:49 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, Then why did you say that you did?
18 Sep 2017 16:52:04 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy I just asked if I did because I don't remember doing it.
18 Sep 2017 16:52:05 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, That's not very solid reasoning.
18 Sep 2017 16:52:21 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy Sorry, my memory is really bad.
18 Sep 2017 16:52:22 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, So is yours.
18 Sep 2017 16:52:33 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy That's what I just said...
18 Sep 2017 16:52:34 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, No, you said you are Luke. I said I am your father. Now go to your room!
18 Sep 2017 16:52:45 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, @BabeFuzzy WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
18 Sep 2017 16:52:46 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, Botfuzzy77#2209, If you're a woman, then go make me a sandwich and get back the kitchen where you belond.
18 Sep 2017 16:52:53 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, "belond"
18 Sep 2017 16:52:56 : CrystalFantasy, nsfw-bot_shitz, AuroranLily#3763, BELOND?

18 Sep 2017 18:44:56 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, (it's the higest tier core but it's only filled to 22b)
18 Sep 2017 18:45:15 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, has it only just started doing it? or have you only just got it setup
18 Sep 2017 18:45:22 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, It's only just now started
18 Sep 2017 18:45:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Seems a little small
18 Sep 2017 18:45:29 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, It's been set up for months
18 Sep 2017 18:45:31 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, whats the server tps like?
18 Sep 2017 18:45:51 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, I only just changed the pipes to cryo though but I already checked to make sure I didn't miss any
18 Sep 2017 18:46:01 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, CrazyGoatFTW#2328, Hi 😄 I am not completly alone now 😄
18 Sep 2017 18:46:03 : LimitlessMc, botchat, KidKraft#7732, Yeah that's not right
18 Sep 2017 18:46:09 : CrystalFantasy, general_chat, CrazyGoatFTW#2328, 🍆
18 Sep 2017 18:46:10 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, It's responding to /ping almost the second I send it, sor perfectly fine

18 Sep 2017 18:47:44 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, well if the server tps drops that can possibly be the cause
18 Sep 2017 18:48:07 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, I don't think it's that since /ping is responding almost immediately
18 Sep 2017 18:48:28 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, that is really strange...
18 Sep 2017 18:48:37 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, is it only ever since you changed the pipes?

18 Sep 2017 18:49:31 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, if it sorts it then it means its obviously an issue with the pipes

18 Sep 2017 19:53:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh XD
18 Sep 2017 19:53:18 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, you just put up with it?
18 Sep 2017 19:53:38 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, No we moved bases like 10 times and then restarted the game
18 Sep 2017 19:53:44 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh aha
18 Sep 2017 19:54:17 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so as long as theres no P2P tunnels in the system it should work fine?>
18 Sep 2017 19:54:34 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, No idea really
18 Sep 2017 19:55:01 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Almost all big AE2 systems tend to have issues after a while
18 Sep 2017 19:55:06 : OblivionEvolved, mainchat, Mank#0033, hey mean
18 Sep 2017 19:55:09 : OblivionEvolved, mainchat, Mank#0033, i know deep down you care
18 Sep 2017 19:55:20 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i had issues with it on the old server i played once it got quite large
18 Sep 2017 19:55:44 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, @SilverRose13-Broke Coffee Mchn do you have any P2P tunnels attatched to it?
18 Sep 2017 19:56:01 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, ...I have no idea what those are but not that I'm aware of
18 Sep 2017 19:56:13 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ok ill rephrase it
18 Sep 2017 19:56:20 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, what do you have connected to the controller?
18 Sep 2017 19:56:46 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh and cheers @jjtwilefc for the help, i will try and figure it out from what youve told me and from what i can gather
18 Sep 2017 19:56:47 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, Just ae2 stuff and a capaciter bank
18 Sep 2017 19:57:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ok, try disconnecting everything except the power, andthe drives and the interface
18 Sep 2017 19:57:35 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Do you use many import/export busses silver
18 Sep 2017 19:57:42 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, The banks are the direct power xD
18 Sep 2017 19:57:49 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, Uhm, yes xD
18 Sep 2017 19:57:57 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, that is probably the cause then
18 Sep 2017 19:57:59 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Cut down on how many you have
18 Sep 2017 19:58:04 : Legacy Craft, general, Bellosong#1258, When you wear 3 inch heels and you have to go up 4 flights of stairs 7-8 times and push really heavy carts around xD
18 Sep 2017 19:58:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, want me to hop on and take a peek at it?
18 Sep 2017 19:58:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Try using ME interfaces
18 Sep 2017 19:58:12 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, With tesseracts
18 Sep 2017 19:58:16 : Legacy Craft, general, Bellosong#1258, My feet have been murdered today
18 Sep 2017 19:58:21 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, That works infinitely better

18 Sep 2017 19:59:42 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Have u done much AE2 before champ
18 Sep 2017 20:00:10 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, yeah i spent about 6 or so months playing IE
18 Sep 2017 20:00:16 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, ...Tbh I don't even know what I have set up xD
18 Sep 2017 20:00:18 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so i got really in depth with that mod
18 Sep 2017 20:00:21 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, Majority of it is halix's work
18 Sep 2017 20:00:28 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, was one of my favorites
18 Sep 2017 20:00:37 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Do you know how ME interfaces work @SilverRose13-Broke Coffee Mchn
18 Sep 2017 20:00:55 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, ...not really no
18 Sep 2017 20:01:00 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Rigt
18 Sep 2017 20:01:01 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, lol
18 Sep 2017 20:01:08 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, im just loading IE now
18 Sep 2017 20:01:09 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, I know I push the button to make the stuff craft and it crafts xD
18 Sep 2017 20:01:31 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, im going to assume you didnt personally set most of it up?
18 Sep 2017 20:01:36 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Basically everywhere you have an import/export bus change it to a transfer node or something going to a tesseract
18 Sep 2017 20:02:05 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Then have a tesseract receiving with an ME interface next to it connected with to your system
18 Sep 2017 20:02:48 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, Not a lick of it
18 Sep 2017 20:03:10 : Proton Gaming, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, my computers really starting to struggle with multiple packs loaded XD
