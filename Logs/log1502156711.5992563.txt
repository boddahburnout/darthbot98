08 Aug 2017 01:50:58 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, As in 22min ago ;lv gave me a higher score
08 Aug 2017 01:51:29 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, I changed the way the score is calculated with this update
08 Aug 2017 01:51:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and you also lost your 150k large damage xD which gave a lot of score
08 Aug 2017 01:51:47 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, I was above 7mil before you started doing stuff, then 6, now 5
08 Aug 2017 01:51:56 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Ah
08 Aug 2017 01:52:07 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, I guess?
08 Aug 2017 01:52:24 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, crystal lost like 1m as well
08 Aug 2017 01:53:43 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, ...Apparently I stll had 6.7 mil score after my damage was reset?

08 Aug 2017 01:54:13 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it prob didnt go though, took me like 4-5 patches after to actually clean up the mess from the changes
08 Aug 2017 01:54:33 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, the large damage may have gone through to the level card, but not to the score calculator
08 Aug 2017 01:54:35 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, So what took off 300k the first time?
08 Aug 2017 01:55:05 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I reduced the incease in score from having more takedowns
08 Aug 2017 01:55:15 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Alright
08 Aug 2017 01:55:16 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so its more balanced
08 Aug 2017 01:55:35 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Score still needs a lot of tweaking tho
08 Aug 2017 01:55:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Let's check prestige then
