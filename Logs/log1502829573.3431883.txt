15 Aug 2017 23:59:24 : Mythical Trinity, rp_dev, That Little Korean Girl#1386, The admin village will be a few chuncks in size depending on the amount of admins
15 Aug 2017 23:59:38 : Mythical Trinity, rp_dev, That Little Korean Girl#1386, each admin should have their private 20x20 plot they can build and edit how ever they wish
15 Aug 2017 23:59:48 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, gut where did u use the clone machine?
15 Aug 2017 23:59:57 : Mythical Trinity, rp_dev, That Little Korean Girl#1386, admins are not allowed to give themselves infinite supplies of items as it would be unfair advantage
16 Aug 2017 00:00:07 : Mythical Trinity, rp_dev, That Little Korean Girl#1386, Admin village is unreachable to users.
16 Aug 2017 00:00:27 : Mythical Trinity, rp_dev, That Little Korean Girl#1386, We will set it far away like 950,000 blocks
