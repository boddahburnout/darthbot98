20 Jul 2016 00:54:18 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, v simple
20 Jul 2016 00:54:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, I remember that happening to another server...
20 Jul 2016 00:54:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, :|
20 Jul 2016 00:54:24 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, can do it in 4 lines
20 Jul 2016 00:54:26 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, i think
20 Jul 2016 00:54:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, Same
20 Jul 2016 00:54:33 : Cipher, music, Akincifenwa#5072, well YOU can but i cant
20 Jul 2016 00:54:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, the admin got super paranoid so the server saved every like five minutes
20 Jul 2016 00:54:43 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Line 1, convert input to a list
20 Jul 2016 00:54:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, I played on a server where it crashed one day and was down for like 2 days
20 Jul 2016 00:54:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, but it disrupted the play
20 Jul 2016 00:54:51 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Line 2, append list to playlist list
20 Jul 2016 00:54:58 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Line 3, write to Json
20 Jul 2016 00:55:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, clearly this server is better than that server.
20 Jul 2016 00:55:10 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Line 4, update playlist from read from json file
20 Jul 2016 00:55:11 : Cipher, music, Akincifenwa#5072, first time i came across json file was while hacking a game le
20 Jul 2016 00:55:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, Yeah

20 Jul 2016 00:55:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, I forgot what else i was going to say
20 Jul 2016 00:55:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, agreed.
20 Jul 2016 00:55:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, This server is basically my home server
20 Jul 2016 00:56:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, mine too
20 Jul 2016 00:56:38 : Cipher, music, Akincifenwa#5072, e.g `<employees>

20 Jul 2016 00:56:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, I havent played on this server for like 4 months to a year like some people, but still.
20 Jul 2016 00:56:51 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, looks complicated
20 Jul 2016 00:56:59 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but i dont need to actually read it
20 Jul 2016 00:57:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, when i commit to a server, I go 100%

20 Jul 2016 00:57:20 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, python wrapper will take care of doing all the hard part
20 Jul 2016 00:57:25 : Cipher, music, Wertfuzzy77#0274, i just need to tell it what to do
20 Jul 2016 00:57:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xPalkia(lugia)#8149, Limitless is the only server on my list apart from the pixelmonmod safari server
20 Jul 2016 00:57:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, PacMen#1450, I have three badges that took me a little while to do, but i'm proud of them.
