02 Apr 2017 13:46:34 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, Welcome to the **Pokemon Battle Sim**!
Here you fight together against Pokemon Bosses. There are 4 areas, *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard* and *Insane*.	
To fight a boss, you use the command `;pokebattle`, a set of moves you will fight the boss with, and a location you want to fight in. (The bot will default to the area best suited for you level if left blank)
An example of this is the following:
`;pokebattle ngfse easy`
which means you will be fighting the easy boss with battle combo of Normal, Grass, Fire, Steel, and Electric.
You can use any combination of the 10 moves which can be found on `;types`

02 Apr 2017 13:49:56 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, Welcome to the **Pokemon Battle Sim**!
Here you fight together against Pokemon Bosses. There are 4 areas, *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard* and *Insane*.	
To fight a boss, you use the command `;pokebattle`, a set of moves you will fight the boss with, and a location you want to fight in. (The bot will default to the area best suited for you level if left blank)
An example of this is the following:
`;pokebattle ngfse easy`
which means you will be fighting the easy boss with battle combo of Normal, Grass, Fire, Steel, and Electric.
You can use any combination of the 10 moves which can be found on `;types`
