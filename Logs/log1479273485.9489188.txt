17 Nov 2016 02:38:42 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Its very possible, Religion has always helped people both feel important, and be thankful for what you have, most major world religions are based in that. They all strive to find a meaning for who and what people are, and why we exist, and lots of people use that as a way to be important, and something to hold onto when they get lost or are stressed. Its just not something I need, I like finding my own way though life, finding my own meaning, instead of just being told what my purpose is
17 Nov 2016 02:39:20 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, i need help i guess. too stressed
