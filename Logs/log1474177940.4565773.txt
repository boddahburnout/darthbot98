18 Sep 2016 06:41:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, After reading the outcome of the polls I'd have to agree with D3's sentiment. "Challenge" doesn't mean including arbitrary wait times to things that are really early processes to getting the most you can out of your pokemon to actually start enjoying the game, it just adds a bunch of tedium to the server, were we have to wait long periods of time before we can do the actual thing we really want to do, and that is not waiting around doing nothing as we wait for the Iv's to become avaliable to be checked again, or playing minecraft to have to get material (Which I might add is sometimes unavaible on this server) I understand not making things free, so overall I'm fine with option 2 or 3, but its just the aspect that breeding shouldn't really be all to much of a challanging process, fighting other people and creating events of us to do and things of the sort would give us that challenge, this server seems to want to provide.

18 Sep 2016 06:51:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Like I understand, I really do and hell I doubt the whole needing to have gems to check iv things would be all too terrible, infact it seems like people would also be fine with just having diamonds be the cost. Its among the issue that some things on this server just aren't avaliable to get in the first place. I mean I really wish I understood the thought process Jay. (Leaving this message for the later staff) You want people to wait/and or pay for IV checking...why? It's a basic process that really anyone can do, but why make people wait for it? Does it add anything to the server? What makes waiting difficult? What makes waiting challenging, really it just seems like to this option you just want people to sit around for more eggs, hatch them, Iv check one egg, then hatch another single egg in a time frame of what? Toph said the previous wait time was 15 minutes? So seeing as you'd most likely go for the same amount of time this way around I find it just...inot the best course of action. I mean all I do is build and breed, I don't battle because my pokemon aren't bred yet, and I can breed them because shit cost too much to do so. I'm having fun I guess, but I'm not having the most fun I can, I can't breed all the pokemon I want to without high cost, and I definitely don't want to wait some stupid time to check the iv of one pokemon alone...Having to watch a full episode of Silicon Valley just to iv check 4 pokemon
18 Sep 2016 06:52:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Overall either way, anything would be better than what we have
18 Sep 2016 06:52:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And I really shouldn't complain
18 Sep 2016 06:53:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Seeing as the owner has alll the power I doubt talking to the staff about it will do anything different (Aside from talk jay's ear off) I'm a new player of this server and you guys ARE right, there isn't another server like it.
18 Sep 2016 06:54:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And I don't know how busy you tend to be when it comes to helping out our issue, but it seems like we do have some issues that needed to be talked about, and actually spoken with, with the community to come to a plausiable consensus.
18 Sep 2016 06:55:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I'm prepared to get my dick out.
18 Sep 2016 06:55:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, Can i ask you to do my essays since you're doing one rn lol
18 Sep 2016 06:55:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Oh yea thats all nice and lovely harambe
18 Sep 2016 06:55:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Take another jab at the guy who is writing a lot
18 Sep 2016 06:55:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Oh look at him, he's typing a lot of words.
18 Sep 2016 06:56:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, lol Just joking damn, can't have fun
18 Sep 2016 06:56:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, No! Fun is for the weak!
18 Sep 2016 06:56:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Also I just don't want my statements to be swept under the rug by playing this off as just a silly jape
18 Sep 2016 06:56:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I really do enjoy this server and I want to see it improve.
18 Sep 2016 06:57:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I may goof around and call you all faggots but overall this server is really fun and nice, relax escape from the daily grind
18 Sep 2016 06:57:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well we all tend to sit around and complain about everything, but I feel like things rarely change, but again this could just be a thing where we need to wait to see progress
18 Sep 2016 06:58:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But I just wanted to know were those 3 options what the players wanted
18 Sep 2016 06:58:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Or was it just what Jay was willing to compromise
18 Sep 2016 06:59:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, He's the owner of the server right? And we are the players, I understand having a general mindset for how you want your server to play and go down, but isn't the main thing to try and please to players? Also Banning the hacker and Scamming scum?
18 Sep 2016 06:59:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, True but he can't please everyone
18 Sep 2016 07:00:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I know but it seems like all our wishes are very small (In my mind) and possibly easy to change if thou art willing
18 Sep 2016 07:00:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Extened the world board a bit so people can find some new land that hasn't been touched up the asshole (If the server can handle it that is)
18 Sep 2016 07:00:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Don't make the process of IV checking hell or diffcult for nonsensical reasons
18 Sep 2016 07:00:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Also we need money fam
18 Sep 2016 07:00:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, plz
18 Sep 2016 07:01:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, they are but which wish should he accept? option one,two,third?
18 Sep 2016 07:01:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Wha?
18 Sep 2016 07:01:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Cause like harambe do you do any breeding?
18 Sep 2016 07:02:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, Not as much
18 Sep 2016 07:02:26 : My Personal Server, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **Soner**(No Role) is now Offline!
18 Sep 2016 07:02:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well Breeding is already a rather..challenging process of its own
18 Sep 2016 07:03:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Like Breeding already comes with inheret challenge
18 Sep 2016 07:03:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, One thing it's fucking random, you need to catch good IV pokemon to begin with
18 Sep 2016 07:03:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Then you need to have those pokemon fuck and then pray that you get all the iv's you wanted
18 Sep 2016 07:03:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mean after a while the process gets much easier when you have two pokemon with the same general IVs
18 Sep 2016 07:04:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, no make love sir
18 Sep 2016 07:04:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Ok ok, make sweet sweet love to a ditto
18 Sep 2016 07:04:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, aaay
18 Sep 2016 07:04:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But then you still aren't done
18 Sep 2016 07:04:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Because what about the nature of the pokemon

18 Sep 2016 07:04:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, adamant lel
18 Sep 2016 07:05:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, There already is a bunch of wait time to checking IVs and the start of it all is waiting for a god damn egg to hatch
18 Sep 2016 07:05:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Then you throw away the garbage pokemon and keep the good brood
18 Sep 2016 07:05:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And this isn't just a one time then this is a thing you do across most of the pokemon you wish to use because who is just gonna use garbage IV/EV pokemon when you are that indepth with pokemon
18 Sep 2016 07:05:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, If you are already worried about EVs
18 Sep 2016 07:06:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Then the next step is to be worried about IVs

18 Sep 2016 07:06:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And then the whole process of training and breeding starts again, and you aren't even doing the fun part of pokemon, you are doing the jobber aspect of pokemon
18 Sep 2016 07:07:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, You aren't battling, you aren't getting badges, you aren't winning tourneys are becoming a gym leader or be apart of the elite 4, you aren't fighting trainers or legends or stroking your dick to the sound of Sweden.
18 Sep 2016 07:07:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, You are just sitting in your house, checking ivs and praying that you get lucky with a DKnot and an everstone
18 Sep 2016 07:08:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Adding any more Monotony to my life of this server and I'd be sooner to blow my brains out, I already spend half of my time here digging out blocks to build shit, the last thing I need is making the process for making good pokemon take more time than it already does.

18 Sep 2016 07:09:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, That too
18 Sep 2016 07:09:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Even with that beta 9 fix the traders still seem like they are everywhere
18 Sep 2016 07:09:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Do we need to get rid of them first or something?
18 Sep 2016 07:09:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, i don't think traders are the problem
18 Sep 2016 07:10:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, trainers spawn for me but pay little
18 Sep 2016 07:10:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, 10-60 is a small amount but it's better than nothing right?
18 Sep 2016 07:10:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, yeah of course
18 Sep 2016 07:10:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I just don't understand why we can't sell drops to NPCs
18 Sep 2016 07:10:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Like most of all other servers I've played on
18 Sep 2016 07:10:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, I thought it was a bug? is it disabled?
18 Sep 2016 07:10:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Is it a bug?
18 Sep 2016 07:11:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I wouldn't know
18 Sep 2016 07:11:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, I don't know, but even if we sold to npc the price wouldn't be high
18 Sep 2016 07:11:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Doesn't matter better than the obsolute nothing we have now
18 Sep 2016 07:11:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Literally when I first came on the prices for everything were high
18 Sep 2016 07:11:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Now everything is like 100-300
18 Sep 2016 07:12:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, true, and starting money should be 1k
18 Sep 2016 07:12:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I don't think it needs to go that far

18 Sep 2016 07:13:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, We need money to buy chunks, we need money to buy building blocks from the shops and then that money goes back into the server
18 Sep 2016 07:13:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, When we sell on the market thats well and good, but what about the assholes like me who spent all the money they made from the market game on buy chunks to build stupid shit on.
18 Sep 2016 07:13:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, what was it again you can own 32 chunks and each cost 250
18 Sep 2016 07:14:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, why buy chunks tbh
18 Sep 2016 07:14:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I have a lot of stuff that I don't want people to touch pfft.

18 Sep 2016 07:15:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Oh in their inventory?
18 Sep 2016 07:15:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well fuck, I'm shit out of luck now aren't I
18 Sep 2016 07:15:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, can mods check inv before?
18 Sep 2016 07:15:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I don't really know agian I joined after reset
18 Sep 2016 07:15:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, they can take items back give to you then ban:P
18 Sep 2016 07:15:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Oh sweet, but what if they already put in chest or wasted it
18 Sep 2016 07:16:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Then it just comes down to you say what you previously had
18 Sep 2016 07:16:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Harambe#3735, lol idk but what are you going to do when you used all chunks?
18 Sep 2016 07:17:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Build high and lower
18 Sep 2016 07:17:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Someone told me you were able to buy more chunks in the past
18 Sep 2016 07:17:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Really I just don't get it.
18 Sep 2016 07:17:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mainly probably complain because the 3rd option is stupid to me compared to the 2nd
18 Sep 2016 07:18:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Diamonds are required vs a wait time.
18 Sep 2016 07:18:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, If i go out and mine for a few moments with a good fortune 3 pick
18 Sep 2016 07:18:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I can get a stack of diamonds in maybe an hour or 2
18 Sep 2016 07:18:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, that means 64 IV checks
18 Sep 2016 07:19:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, If the server goes for a 15 minutes wait time
18 Sep 2016 07:19:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, would that mean that checking 64 ivs would take 16 hours?

18 Sep 2016 07:21:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Again just assuming that Jay would make the wait time for checking one iv on a single pokemon 15 minutes
18 Sep 2016 07:25:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Ah oh well
18 Sep 2016 07:25:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, My words are probably falling on death ears at this point and I'll probably be memed on as that no life who talks to much
18 Sep 2016 07:26:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But I shall take those memes in stride

18 Sep 2016 13:30:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Did you breed?
18 Sep 2016 13:31:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MountainDewRed#4034, yes
18 Sep 2016 13:31:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Did you breed a lot?
18 Sep 2016 13:31:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MountainDewRed#4034, yes
18 Sep 2016 13:31:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Starting from scratch, how long did it take you to get perfect ivs for a particular pokemon?
18 Sep 2016 13:31:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Not full 6's just 5's
18 Sep 2016 13:32:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MountainDewRed#4034, i haven't done that yet but i'm getting there just going for micro/ginorm
18 Sep 2016 13:32:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mean before the server reset
18 Sep 2016 13:32:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, you said you breeded a lot right?
18 Sep 2016 13:33:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MountainDewRed#4034, yes but never got more than two 31's
18 Sep 2016 13:34:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MountainDewRed#4034, also did exessive ditto breeding
18 Sep 2016 13:35:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, How much time do you think was just spent waiting for IV's to be able to be checked again?

18 Sep 2016 13:41:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, With a 5iv-male of the same egg group, Dittos of all natures and a max happiness breeding it took me 1-1.5 a day.

18 Sep 2016 13:42:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Like I question how yall survived back then
18 Sep 2016 13:42:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Scratch meaning not having at least a ditto for every 31 IV?
18 Sep 2016 13:42:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, yep
18 Sep 2016 13:42:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, "Back then" server was nice.
18 Sep 2016 13:42:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, You dont breed.
18 Sep 2016 13:42:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, You hunt for dittos.
18 Sep 2016 13:43:00 : Penguins, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **xPalkia(lugia)**(Mewtwo) is now Online!
18 Sep 2016 13:43:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mean I'm still breeding I HAVE a ditto now
18 Sep 2016 13:43:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, "a ditto"
18 Sep 2016 13:43:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But I just bred pokemon with their female counterparts
18 Sep 2016 13:43:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, 3iv ditto
18 Sep 2016 13:43:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Attack Spa and SPDef
18 Sep 2016 13:43:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, You need something to give the pokemon the option to get their stats
18 Sep 2016 13:44:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, You need 1-3 dittos with the rest
18 Sep 2016 13:44:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well overall I'm less talking about the concept of becoming breed ready
18 Sep 2016 13:44:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I'm talking about wait possible wait times to check iv's alone
18 Sep 2016 13:45:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, I told you, if neither of the parents have a specific IV at 31, you wait for it to get to 31 Randomly. That's 1/31 chance.
18 Sep 2016 13:45:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, On average statistics it would take 15-16 eggs for that 1 IV. But there is no use breeding like that.

18 Sep 2016 13:46:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Yeah, but at the end its the same amount of time as breeding with random IV parents.
18 Sep 2016 13:46:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, For one poke. Worth for the second.
18 Sep 2016 13:47:03 : Penguins, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **xPalkia(lugia)**(Mewtwo) is now Offline!
18 Sep 2016 13:47:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mean the way I have it set up now I'm just opening it up so I can breed within the egg groups
18 Sep 2016 13:47:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Why?
18 Sep 2016 13:47:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well along side with breeding things with my ditto
18 Sep 2016 13:48:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I'm currently breeding a tirtourga
18 Sep 2016 13:48:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I was lucky enough to get a female tirtourga so I just matched it with my already perfect shellder
18 Sep 2016 13:48:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Yeah, my question remains. Why?
18 Sep 2016 13:50:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well at the current moment I don't have much on my mating plate I have two tirtourga's mating currently one with shellder with perfects and one with the ditto, my hopes is that one of them will spawn female and the other will spawn male
18 Sep 2016 13:51:14 : Cipher, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **Dudubidu**(Grunt) is now Online!
18 Sep 2016 13:51:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, I still don't think you understand the question... Why are you breeding? What do you want to "set it up so you can breed withing egg groups"?
18 Sep 2016 13:52:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, OH!
18 Sep 2016 13:52:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, It's just my option right now, the ditto allows me to breed those 3 stats to basically any pokemon, and if I had more dittos in the stats that I'm lacking I could probably just do that
18 Sep 2016 13:53:14 : Cipher, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **Dudubidu**(Grunt) is now Offline!
18 Sep 2016 13:53:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Alright. Say you breed the 5ivs. Then?
18 Sep 2016 13:53:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, So I've breed 5 iv's in my shellder which Ive spoken about before
18 Sep 2016 13:54:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, It being in only water type 3, but I also want that tirt as also previously stated which is in both water 3 and water 1
18 Sep 2016 13:54:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, I'm actually curious about how this will turn out... What stats are you missing again?
18 Sep 2016 13:54:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, From which?
18 Sep 2016 13:54:58 : Penguins, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, **Olivia**(Xerneas) is now Online!

18 Sep 2016 13:55:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, The dittos.
18 Sep 2016 13:55:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, the other 3

18 Sep 2016 13:59:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Overall right now I'm just letting like egg groups seep into each other Water 3 is going into water 1 and once water 1 is perfect I can go a lot more places, because some pokemon in water one are in Monster and Field

18 Sep 2016 14:00:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, So with a perfect Tirtouga male I can start breeding Perfect Slowpokes, yeah it takes time and it shifts every new egg type
18 Sep 2016 14:00:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But I believe it's about the same speed as trying to find a god damn ditto with all those needed iv's in perfect conditions

18 Sep 2016 14:01:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Survivra#7191, interesting
18 Sep 2016 14:02:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, It's my work around, but maybe I should just trade these mews for perfect two Iv dittos and then one last 1 iv ditto
18 Sep 2016 14:02:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I'm sure somebody would trade a ditto for a mew
18 Sep 2016 14:03:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, D3 dude thats like... really kind of you, but why?
18 Sep 2016 14:05:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Curiosity.

18 Sep 2016 14:08:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, D3NSH1N#8702, Im curious of what you will do after you have bred enough pokes.
18 Sep 2016 14:08:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Are you curious about my breeding process or are you curious about my attitude on breeding
18 Sep 2016 14:10:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Now I have everything I need pokemon wise to start breeding at better speeds, but more of my issue is, what will come of /iv once Jay makes his changes

18 Sep 2016 14:10:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I don't want ot have to wait 15 minutes everytime I want to check the iv of a single poke which might not have the things I want.
18 Sep 2016 14:11:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But I guess it's time for me to make a shit ton of cake
18 Sep 2016 14:12:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Also I guess it would be best to just put this down lol

18 Sep 2016 15:31:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, @MoshonT I started breeding from 0iv to 5iv initially. I started with an ekans to cover field and its other egg group. I used no Dittos, only other pokes in its egg group with 31s. Took me a total of about 5-6 days for my first 5iv. Once you get that and develop a 5iv in each egg group (as you plan to do) it's much easier to breed perfect pokes than using Dittos. Most sites recommend Dittos but if you don't have 31 IVs in the stats you need its no different to use another poke from the breeding group of the one you're trying to breed.
18 Sep 2016 15:32:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well here is what I'm asking why did it take 5-6 days to make your first Perfect Ivs?
18 Sep 2016 15:33:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Bc I was using pokes of different types from diff egg groups, so terrain was a factor. Plus it's a lot of luck when you start from scratch. I wasn't very lucky at first.
18 Sep 2016 15:33:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, *from same egg group
18 Sep 2016 15:33:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, ...I'm guna have hell getting a perfect Typhlosion because I have no luck xD
18 Sep 2016 15:34:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, And 12.5% female rate. Rip you
18 Sep 2016 15:34:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, yeeea...
18 Sep 2016 15:34:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, But it's my favorite, so meep.
18 Sep 2016 15:34:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, Also, God morning, Toph.
18 Sep 2016 15:34:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, god*
18 Sep 2016 15:34:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, good*
18 Sep 2016 15:34:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Do you think the time thing ever hindered you? Like there is something I like about the current IV system
18 Sep 2016 15:34:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lyrina25#3251, bleh go to hell cold finges...
18 Sep 2016 15:35:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, It's quick when you have the mat to check the ivs
18 Sep 2016 15:35:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, But becuase there is a lot of mat you can't get you can't check a lot of ivs for a lot of types of pokemon

18 Sep 2016 15:35:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, I did this when there WAS the 15min cool down.
18 Sep 2016 15:35:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I know
18 Sep 2016 15:35:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, So no
18 Sep 2016 15:36:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Which makes it reasonable when you say it takes 5-6 days for you first 5 ivs and 2 days for my first 5ivs with no dittos
18 Sep 2016 15:36:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, The fastest you can breed a poke is like 45mins right? And it produces one egg. Is 15mins a big deal then?
18 Sep 2016 15:36:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Actually my machines sometimes produce 2 eggs
18 Sep 2016 15:36:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And I have multiple pokemon breeding
18 Sep 2016 15:36:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Yea sometimes. So 30mins
18 Sep 2016 15:37:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I mainly tend to have 5 eggs in my inventory with a lampet
18 Sep 2016 15:37:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, If you have multiple then yea it can wear you down. But people were literally doing it for years on this server with the cooldown
18 Sep 2016 15:38:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Lol just because you settle for less doesn't mean you deserve it, and a system like tha WOULD slowly grind me
18 Sep 2016 15:38:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Also hai @Lyrina25
18 Sep 2016 15:38:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Also fuck off @MoshonT
18 Sep 2016 15:38:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Lol
18 Sep 2016 15:38:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Lol
18 Sep 2016 15:38:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Like I said, was possible before and would be possible again
18 Sep 2016 15:38:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, Is it suboptimal? Yes
18 Sep 2016 15:39:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, But feasible entirely

18 Sep 2016 15:41:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, And FYI I voted for option 2 and expressed that to Jay. But it will be manageable regardless.
18 Sep 2016 15:41:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Same here
18 Sep 2016 15:41:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Option 2 is just the most plausible option
18 Sep 2016 15:41:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, even if its a high diamond cost it would be a better time frame
18 Sep 2016 15:42:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Topheralan#1202, And encourages players to play on the server, not just sit there.
