04 Aug 2017 00:53:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, There are two ways the "Minecraft Server Hosting" hosts work. One is they just throw a bunch of minecraft server instances on good hardware and hope for the best. the other is they give each instance its own logical procsesser core. Both of those are stupid in terms of getting performance out of them.
04 Aug 2017 00:54:10 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, that is really cool
04 Aug 2017 00:54:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, While its true minecraft uses only one thread for the game logic. that doesnt mean you only need give it one
04 Aug 2017 00:54:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, I think we should get the little PGN symbol as an emoji
04 Aug 2017 00:55:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, If you only give a minecraft server one logical procsesser core then both the game logic and the nettworking has to be done on that core. Meaning you'll have ether less time for the gamelogic, causing lag. Or you'll be running the networking less, causing higher ping and less responsiveness.
04 Aug 2017 00:58:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, Most of the $$ of the hosts you all sent here looks like it goes to there support team and less towards running the servers. Meaning just as i suspect, they cram their servers.
04 Aug 2017 00:58:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, So thanks but no thanks
04 Aug 2017 00:58:25 : Personal Server, general, Pixel Zane ~The Sylveon~#2042, @Zen @707 are we ready????
04 Aug 2017 00:58:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, Theres a reason our server was always lag free
04 Aug 2017 00:58:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, It takes me a long time to find a good host. but its almost always well worth it

Well spongebob is based on a real island called Bikini which had the first nuclear bomb hit.
Some fish there did mutate and flead the area.

Proof is the guy who made it said it himself
Second name is bikini bottom which bikini is name of the island
The island that is at the top of the water is thats right Bikini.
It is strange how a cartoon is based off a tragic event

04 Aug 2017 15:28:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, as john knew he stole our house
04 Aug 2017 15:28:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, this is the only true
04 Aug 2017 15:28:48 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, No matter what way you spin this, you *intended* to deceive staff
04 Aug 2017 15:28:49 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, john can confirm
04 Aug 2017 15:28:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, jjtwilefc#7374, @Jimmy can you confirm?

04 Aug 2017 15:29:21 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, and this was the only way to take the house back
04 Aug 2017 15:29:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Ok, and you think the correct way to deal with this is to deceive staff members, who had only good intentions, in order to get around a claim?
04 Aug 2017 15:29:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, jjtwilefc#7374, You completely looted the base, you didn't take it back
04 Aug 2017 15:29:58 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Oh wow, really?

04 Aug 2017 15:35:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, instead of lying to staff to get stuff back you could have always tried to talk it out like a normal person
04 Aug 2017 15:35:51 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, i did
04 Aug 2017 15:35:59 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Did you talk to staff about it?
04 Aug 2017 15:36:20 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, and they told me that if it was claimed by TizzIz i couldn't do nothing
04 Aug 2017 15:36:58 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, 'Staff word is final' is one of our rules too, y'know

04 Aug 2017 15:41:34 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Lightning#6734, probably because my beloved gf BROKE the invite cmd
04 Aug 2017 15:41:55 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Lightning#6734, i can fix and invite her in if you'd like though?
04 Aug 2017 15:42:03 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, jjtwilefc#7374, Yeah ok

04 Aug 2017 15:49:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Admittedly they didn't grief TizzIz's place
04 Aug 2017 15:49:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, what if this is ploy to kill MC on the PC and promote console play
04 Aug 2017 15:49:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, not that that will actually happen
04 Aug 2017 15:49:46 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, jesus this is a real throwback
04 Aug 2017 15:49:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, He's getting a 7 day ban regardless
04 Aug 2017 15:50:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I think that is fair
04 Aug 2017 15:50:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If Tizz doesn't come back on it can stay permanent
04 Aug 2017 15:50:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @Macomplete can make the temp longer if he wants
04 Aug 2017 15:51:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, it is still questionable if that other discord is him
04 Aug 2017 15:51:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, That's why I didn't ask 'Tizziz' - I asked Rod

04 Aug 2017 15:52:01 : Shiny Edits, general, FlamePlayz#6408, Hey everyone
04 Aug 2017 15:52:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's a shame discord hides IP addresses, would be super easy to validate
04 Aug 2017 15:52:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that would have been a super easy way to do it yeah
04 Aug 2017 15:52:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But yeah - from now on, apparently we can't trust people to be nice, so don't make changes to a player's anything without them being online in game

04 Aug 2017 15:56:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, double check the ingame IP's to be safe

04 Aug 2017 15:56:56 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, first thing i do when i go in is run to find the guy with my pass
04 Aug 2017 15:57:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, well i just walk around randomly trying to find the schedule person, who passes out the papers with your class list and advisory room
04 Aug 2017 15:57:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I mean, everything's linked to their UUID
04 Aug 2017 15:57:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And it's not a nickname
04 Aug 2017 15:57:52 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, the first week of a new grade/semester is kinda the chill and trying to get your life together week

04 Aug 2017 15:58:06 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, and also the week in which you have the deadline for school supplies
04 Aug 2017 15:58:21 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, we have guides for the first 1 - 2 weeks and when we went up for the vistits we never got told what class we are in or are going to untill we were in it
04 Aug 2017 15:58:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, it safe for me to put code text in herE?
04 Aug 2017 15:58:49 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, we get a piece of paper, then from there on we either go or we don't.
04 Aug 2017 15:59:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah?

04 Aug 2017 16:00:45 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, well there are other ways of telling if someone has hacks
04 Aug 2017 16:00:52 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, ik
04 Aug 2017 16:00:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, are you talkingwith tizzIz?
04 Aug 2017 16:01:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, ip tracking via mc server is dumb easy to find out who's actually who
04 Aug 2017 16:01:05 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, and if its xray, it could just be a resource pack, though thats just as bad
04 Aug 2017 16:01:06 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, but it could even be a texture pack so yeah
04 Aug 2017 16:01:24 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, if its a texture pack or hack i don;t care all the same to me
04 Aug 2017 16:01:53 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, for what time am I banned?
04 Aug 2017 16:01:58 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, 1 week
04 Aug 2017 16:02:08 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, if they are lagging with the memory glitch thing and can see i guess that kind of alright ish
04 Aug 2017 16:02:14 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, why?
04 Aug 2017 16:02:41 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, if its not definite hack client or resource pack, theres not really any worry
04 Aug 2017 16:02:57 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Do we really have to go through it again?

04 Aug 2017 16:03:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, The fact you don't understand the seriousness of what you did kinda reinforces the length of the ban - maybe you'll learn your lesson
04 Aug 2017 16:03:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, 7 days is not a long time
04 Aug 2017 16:03:38 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, it is dude

04 Aug 2017 16:04:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's just matching it with the IP from discord
04 Aug 2017 16:04:32 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, maddog780ca#9376, Never know he might just be a noob

04 Aug 2017 16:05:40 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, here is the thing, the staff on the server do a lot to help people out and they sacrifice a lot of time for nothing over than to try and give you guys the best experience possible, so for you to lie and decieve one of those people who try so hard just to make sure you guys have fun is dispicable
04 Aug 2017 16:05:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, pls guys
04 Aug 2017 16:05:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, I have 2 day playtime

04 Aug 2017 16:06:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, it is a punishment for something that is not a problem
04 Aug 2017 16:06:53 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Would you prefer people broke the rules, and then said 'Oh, unban me, I want to play!' and we just go 'Ok'
04 Aug 2017 16:06:53 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, it is all resolved
04 Aug 2017 16:06:54 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, he never made it fully and i don;t think he read them yet anyway

04 Aug 2017 16:14:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Macomplete#2338, I don't understand why u pretended to be tizz and now that u needed him, he could get online today on discord
04 Aug 2017 16:14:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's like a lot of the looters in riots - they go on social media and post what they stole, only for the police to track them down
04 Aug 2017 16:15:07 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, He did join in-game
04 Aug 2017 16:15:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Haha yeah

04 Aug 2017 16:17:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Yes if discord showed ip adresses.. all would be so much clearer
04 Aug 2017 16:17:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, jjtwilefc#7374, Illuminati confirmed

04 Aug 2017 16:24:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, I played for about 50 hours and then i had no house
04 Aug 2017 16:24:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Macomplete#2338, U had an argument with Tizz, it's up to u to fix it then.. thats the risk about playing with other players u can't fully trust

04 Aug 2017 16:26:15 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, TizzIz#5542, And John Can confirm that TizzIz and I lived togheter

04 Aug 2017 21:15:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, https://t123test.lima-city.de/Unbenannt1.png
04 Aug 2017 21:15:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, there ya go
04 Aug 2017 21:16:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean he is just trying to trick us again right
04 Aug 2017 21:16:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, who?
04 Aug 2017 21:16:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, ljohn or maddy?
04 Aug 2017 21:16:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, rodii
04 Aug 2017 21:16:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, ye
04 Aug 2017 21:16:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, i said he could apply and he did
04 Aug 2017 21:17:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, but hes acting super dumb
04 Aug 2017 21:17:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, like if he was a 5 year old o nthe internet for the first time
04 Aug 2017 21:17:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean just ban  both accounts...
04 Aug 2017 21:17:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, i dont think its differnt accounts
04 Aug 2017 21:17:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, he is changing his name and ip
04 Aug 2017 21:17:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, i think
04 Aug 2017 21:17:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, his name 100% he is
04 Aug 2017 21:17:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so in terms of minecraft accounts, there are just 1
04 Aug 2017 21:17:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, A person called maddy joined shortly after the ordeal with rodrii was over. I was afk when he initially joined but me and shuck saw him sending a lot of messages to john and acting like they were friends. I can't pull specific lines but it  implied it was rodrii. We took a look round maddy and found that he is part of the same group of friends and they lived with him and gave him their gear (presumably the gear on rodriis inv). After this john sent us those screenshots
04 Aug 2017 21:18:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, yes i think so
04 Aug 2017 21:18:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, he was just asking for ljohns discord
04 Aug 2017 21:18:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, and saying how he loved him
04 Aug 2017 21:18:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, and had somthing to tell him
04 Aug 2017 21:18:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, and couldnt say it in chat
04 Aug 2017 21:19:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, It was also suspicious that when maddy joined, tizz had a sudden change of heart and said you should perms an rodrii instead. This sort of implies to me that rodrii was planning to move onto this new account permanently
04 Aug 2017 21:19:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, In the dc grand general
04 Aug 2017 21:19:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, right so can you confirm for me then that there are 2 minecraft accounts rodrii and mady
04 Aug 2017 21:20:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, should we keep rodri temp banned or perma?
04 Aug 2017 21:20:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, maddy is perma banned
04 Aug 2017 21:20:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, with WS being wonky
04 Aug 2017 21:20:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, it's up to mc to find out
04 Aug 2017 21:20:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, It should be fine light
04 Aug 2017 21:20:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Thanks anyway though 💃
04 Aug 2017 21:20:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, regarding the statement
04 Aug 2017 21:20:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Not what I meant to put
04 Aug 2017 21:21:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, haha
04 Aug 2017 21:21:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, "they banned my ip, but i changed it"
04 Aug 2017 21:21:11 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, hello @Maddy0706 there is evidence to show that you are rodri so please cut the bullshit
04 Aug 2017 21:21:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, That does explain the two different ips
04 Aug 2017 21:21:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, if and IF he did change it
04 Aug 2017 21:21:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, mabye ask ljohn to contimue the conversation on how he did it?
04 Aug 2017 21:21:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, what?
04 Aug 2017 21:21:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Nah leave john
04 Aug 2017 21:21:55 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, what are these evidences?
04 Aug 2017 21:21:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, the only way to find out would be to unban rodrii have him log on and check the ip's
04 Aug 2017 21:22:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, I talked to him before and he was right in sayin it would just be suspicious
04 Aug 2017 21:22:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, if you don't have a static IP it can be changed just by turning your router on and of
04 Aug 2017 21:22:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, mike dont show how ljohn was involved
04 Aug 2017 21:22:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, literally happens to me all the time
04 Aug 2017 21:22:39 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm a girl
04 Aug 2017 21:22:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, he changed his name aswell
04 Aug 2017 21:22:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, mine's been the same forever
04 Aug 2017 21:22:57 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, i can even speak with vocal chat if you want
04 Aug 2017 21:23:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, to show you I'm a girl
04 Aug 2017 21:23:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, your provider has a static IP for you then light, some do some don't
04 Aug 2017 21:23:15 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, shuck#1142, how would you know rodri isnt a girl aswell?
04 Aug 2017 21:23:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, just ask both
04 Aug 2017 21:23:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, to speak
04 Aug 2017 21:23:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, ask rodri to speak in voice chat
04 Aug 2017 21:23:29 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, in the same fucking time
04 Aug 2017 21:23:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, oh my god
04 Aug 2017 21:23:33 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, yes ask him
04 Aug 2017 21:23:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, it's not that difficult
04 Aug 2017 21:23:39 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, is this really so hard?
04 Aug 2017 21:23:43 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, yeah omg
04 Aug 2017 21:23:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah
04 Aug 2017 21:24:07 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, shuck#1142, we have evidence that rodri has a sister and was planning to speak to a admin to prove that 'she' is a girl
04 Aug 2017 21:24:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but how do we solve this massive headache?
04 Aug 2017 21:24:15 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, I mean I am not debating this, there is no debate I am at this point telling you that I have seen the evidence
04 Aug 2017 21:24:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, what?
04 Aug 2017 21:24:32 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, show me these evidences so
04 Aug 2017 21:24:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, just keep the maddy acount banned
04 Aug 2017 21:24:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, what the fuck ahahahahah
04 Aug 2017 21:24:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, what about rodris account?
04 Aug 2017 21:24:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, keep that temp banned
04 Aug 2017 21:25:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, ok
04 Aug 2017 21:25:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, for now
04 Aug 2017 21:25:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, the boss has spoken
04 Aug 2017 21:25:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i go finish coding now ._.
04 Aug 2017 21:25:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, haha
04 Aug 2017 21:25:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I haven't got a brother
04 Aug 2017 21:25:46 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, if rodri is a kid then he's unlikely to have a computer of his own, much less his own house
04 Aug 2017 21:25:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, don't wanna get in the way of staff buisness
04 Aug 2017 21:25:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, Ask em to speak at the same time
04 Aug 2017 21:26:02 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, you would probably hear one or the other
04 Aug 2017 21:26:04 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, if you want I can speak
04 Aug 2017 21:26:10 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, don't know rodrii
04 Aug 2017 21:26:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, your not in the way, I would personally recommend grabbing some popcorn though
04 Aug 2017 21:26:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, oo popcorn
04 Aug 2017 21:26:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, that is a terrible system to authenticate....
04 Aug 2017 21:26:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, both connect in the same time?!?!?!
04 Aug 2017 21:26:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, i don't know how to do it
04 Aug 2017 21:26:56 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, in minecraft
04 Aug 2017 21:26:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Damn this staff shit is harder than I thought it would be haha
04 Aug 2017 21:27:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, I TRIED TO TELL YOU
04 Aug 2017 21:27:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, haha welcome to my world 😛
04 Aug 2017 21:27:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah try actually running the server with EVERYONE crying to you
04 Aug 2017 21:27:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, if they both connected at the same time would they have the same ip?
04 Aug 2017 21:27:46 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, show these evidences at least
04 Aug 2017 21:27:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, if that's him yes
04 Aug 2017 21:27:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, if not, no
04 Aug 2017 21:27:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, they could use the accounts from diffrent locations
04 Aug 2017 21:28:00 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm not rodrii
04 Aug 2017 21:28:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, there's also that
04 Aug 2017 21:28:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Yeah what I was thinkin
04 Aug 2017 21:28:04 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm a girl
04 Aug 2017 21:28:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, there are many ways around it
04 Aug 2017 21:28:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, ljohn is taliking to them in a voice chat
04 Aug 2017 21:28:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but who would go out of their way to do things like that is my ?
04 Aug 2017 21:28:22 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, why can't i play?
04 Aug 2017 21:28:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, there's no reason
04 Aug 2017 21:28:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I personally think that we have all the evidence we need
04 Aug 2017 21:28:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i concur
04 Aug 2017 21:28:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, apparently he was going to get his sister to talk to 'prove' it
04 Aug 2017 21:28:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Same
04 Aug 2017 21:28:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, yep

04 Aug 2017 21:28:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I think the rest of it can be faked what we have seen can no longer be altered or changed
04 Aug 2017 21:29:00 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I just want to play with jumpah
04 Aug 2017 21:29:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i hev advice for you

04 Aug 2017 21:29:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, the person who provided the evidence wished to remain out of it so for them I shall not show it to you
04 Aug 2017 21:30:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, being a staff member you'll wake up, wanna play then immediately get off and say fuck it for a few hours
04 Aug 2017 21:30:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, That maddy types a lot like rodrii if you get what I mean

04 Aug 2017 21:31:35 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, that's not an evidence at all
04 Aug 2017 21:31:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, woulda been easier
04 Aug 2017 21:31:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, xJumpah#0608, hahaha

04 Aug 2017 21:32:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Why?
04 Aug 2017 21:32:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, maddy is just demanding evidence
04 Aug 2017 21:32:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, triggering af
04 Aug 2017 21:32:23 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm not rodriii
04 Aug 2017 21:32:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, goddammit

04 Aug 2017 21:32:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm a girl
04 Aug 2017 21:32:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, also demanding in general
04 Aug 2017 21:32:37 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, girl
04 Aug 2017 21:32:38 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, girl

04 Aug 2017 21:33:17 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, you said someone said something
04 Aug 2017 21:33:24 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, if you don't show me it isn't an evidence
04 Aug 2017 21:33:24 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, because why is it in my interest to ban players, I only ban people when it is called for, my job is to make sure the right people are banned not just to randomly ban people
04 Aug 2017 21:33:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, mike would you like some popcorn? perhaps a scone?

04 Aug 2017 21:35:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, he is pissing me off
04 Aug 2017 21:36:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, oz and mac were nice about it even after he lied to their faces
04 Aug 2017 21:36:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and even mike is trying to remain calm
04 Aug 2017 21:36:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, 😈
04 Aug 2017 21:36:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i would've just banned the guy for a month just for lying to me multiple times
04 Aug 2017 21:36:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but this here would've warranted permanant termination
04 Aug 2017 21:36:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, hes just made it worse for himself
04 Aug 2017 21:37:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Maddy0706#0858, I'm just a girl who wanted to play
04 Aug 2017 21:37:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, buuuuut i'm just a developer 😉
04 Aug 2017 21:37:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I am being as nice as I can be
04 Aug 2017 21:37:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, but to be honest I am at the end of my rope here really
04 Aug 2017 21:37:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, everyone has that breaking point
04 Aug 2017 21:37:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, my inner savage wants to take over
04 Aug 2017 21:37:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, sadly i can see it might possibly come to that
04 Aug 2017 21:37:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, you know what fuck this, give him the perma ban

04 Aug 2017 21:44:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, the banning ehh i don't like to do it but i don't hate it
04 Aug 2017 21:44:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, with jay makin a ftb server there may be some new competition for players thinking about it
04 Aug 2017 21:44:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i doubt it'll be ftb
04 Aug 2017 21:45:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, last thing he said to me
04 Aug 2017 21:45:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, " we're going to have a custom modpack with custom plugins/features unlike any other"
04 Aug 2017 21:45:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, hmm tru
04 Aug 2017 21:45:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, but i still expect it to be the same kinda deal as ftb
04 Aug 2017 21:45:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, same kind of player base
04 Aug 2017 21:45:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but with every old staff shouting that he's gonna make new ones
04 Aug 2017 21:45:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, is there a reason i'm still there
04 Aug 2017 21:45:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, oh yeah mike that thing that i said world editing would lag a ton didnt
04 Aug 2017 21:46:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, so yaya
04 Aug 2017 21:46:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is allways good 😄
04 Aug 2017 21:46:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, i can imagine that you feel some sort of attatchment to pixel
04 Aug 2017 21:46:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I do prefer the server not to lag
04 Aug 2017 21:46:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, well LL
04 Aug 2017 21:46:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i've been a staff/owner for a few years
04 Aug 2017 21:46:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and just to have jay throw us all away is kinda feeling like i've been betrayed
04 Aug 2017 21:47:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, yeah that does suck
04 Aug 2017 21:47:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, its like all the help and service you have done for him
04 Aug 2017 21:47:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, without him even asking me too at that
04 Aug 2017 21:47:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, i never have and never will understand jay
04 Aug 2017 21:48:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i understand him some
04 Aug 2017 21:48:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, but not alot
04 Aug 2017 21:48:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I assume jay was the owner of the pixelmon server?
04 Aug 2017 21:48:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, he closed the server only just when they added the best pokemon in it
04 Aug 2017 21:48:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, yeah
04 Aug 2017 21:48:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, yeah him and his girlfriend
04 Aug 2017 21:48:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and partially me
04 Aug 2017 21:48:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I see I see
04 Aug 2017 21:48:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, oh he's with depthy?
04 Aug 2017 21:48:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, since i have the entire server code,source plugins and all
04 Aug 2017 21:48:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, and he has been forever?
04 Aug 2017 21:48:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, i just never knew
04 Aug 2017 21:49:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, hek
04 Aug 2017 21:49:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, light u remember lolopface?
04 Aug 2017 21:49:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, - ,-

04 Aug 2017 21:49:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, shuck#1142, haha
04 Aug 2017 21:49:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, that explains the big banner outside the old pixel spawn saying 'jay ❤ depthy'
04 Aug 2017 21:49:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lolopface

04 Aug 2017 23:07:30 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It's funny cause he was only banned for 7 days, and now he's gone for good - so I guess we also learned that if staff show leniency, don't make it worse for yourself

05 Aug 2017 03:35:36 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, SilverRose13#0794, I keep timing out tonight, I'll ake that as my cue to get off lol
05 Aug 2017 03:45:30 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, Nah that's not it,  I'm coming back when I get a new graphics card for the beast.
05 Aug 2017 03:46:17 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, Until then can't do much with a graphics card that over heats then crashes every hour.
05 Aug 2017 03:46:25 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ_Phatzo#8045, box fan? o.o
05 Aug 2017 03:46:47 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, Nah that's used for when it's extremely hot
05 Aug 2017 03:46:50 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ_Phatzo#8045, ah
05 Aug 2017 03:47:46 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, I'd rather sit and not play on my PC and save parts than blow more money having to buy a new PC because all my parts are bad.
05 Aug 2017 03:48:56 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, It got some play time a day or two ago but that's because it was 50° here and it kept the card cooled
05 Aug 2017 03:50:11 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, It can run just fine if the temps cool but if it's hot af then it dies every hour. Lol
05 Aug 2017 03:50:53 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, Read the reviews for the card and 60%where good reviews
05 Aug 2017 03:51:22 : Legacy Craft, admin, Wtsoner#4231, Every bad review said something about over heating issue
05 Aug 2017 04:08:58 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Run they're all crazy

05 Aug 2017 05:29:32 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, or does he have permissions to creative?
05 Aug 2017 05:30:30 : Legacy Craft, admin, EmMiERoSe#7854, hm
05 Aug 2017 05:30:37 : Legacy Craft, admin, EmMiERoSe#7854, not i
05 Aug 2017 05:31:18 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, how quill
05 Aug 2017 05:31:31 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, me and kat r looking at it and it didnt give a mining fatigue
05 Aug 2017 05:31:38 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, we are up close
05 Aug 2017 05:32:24 : Legacy Craft, admin, subzero69#9175, kat bbqchickenwing's rank is pilgrim
05 Aug 2017 05:32:24 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, hmm I do not believe any plugin would give the elder guardian as a pet to anyone, but may want to ask soner or sunny about that. Also if anyone did it be nice to know. Also probably best to ask him when he is on about it
05 Aug 2017 05:32:34 : Legacy Craft, admin, subzero69#9175, kat his rank is pligrim
05 Aug 2017 05:32:52 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, ok idk what ranks have lol
05 Aug 2017 05:32:55 : Legacy Craft, admin, subzero69#9175, there is no way he has creative unless a builder or staff gave him creative
05 Aug 2017 05:33:12 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, okay  😃
05 Aug 2017 05:33:37 : Legacy Craft, admin, subzero69#9175, tkat builders and up to dev has creative access
05 Aug 2017 05:33:37 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Move it by mine cart duh
05 Aug 2017 05:34:01 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, well best talk to soner and sunny about plugins if there is a pet deal since they mess with plugins, also good to talk to all staff about it see if anyone gave him one, then talk to him about it as well.
05 Aug 2017 05:34:42 : Legacy Craft, admin, subzero69#9175, um is soner asleep or is he high
05 Aug 2017 05:34:42 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, <https://youtu.be/s8a4ODDvE0g>

05 Aug 2017 05:40:14 : Legacy Craft, admin, GamerKatland#1817, BBQ says he did a trick using the nether portals to teleport it from one place to another

05 Aug 2017 07:16:59 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, @GamerKatland I was told by him that it was grief protection, gave mining fatigue. wouldn't despawn because "I got it from a ocean monument, naturally"
05 Aug 2017 07:17:31 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, he made a griefing protection using a naturally generated guardian that can't despawn.

06 Aug 2017 03:26:33 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, again, he said it was for grief protection...
06 Aug 2017 03:26:49 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, well a witch farm has nothing to do with an elder guardian

06 Aug 2017 03:28:21 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, he is being awfully sketchy, but I gotta say, he has some rad ideas, like building an absolutely giant iron grinder. It may skew the economy which is why I got a bit worried when he told me.
06 Aug 2017 03:28:32 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, it won't
06 Aug 2017 03:28:45 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, not with how the economy is rn
06 Aug 2017 03:28:51 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, and as i can see, she doesnt do much with jobs
06 Aug 2017 03:28:52 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, because you took a shit on the price of iron? is iron not sellable?
06 Aug 2017 03:28:56 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, last time i checked she had 300 something bucks
06 Aug 2017 03:29:11 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, iron is not sellable on the regular adminshop
06 Aug 2017 03:29:12 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, he* has a female player skin from borrowing a friend's account
06 Aug 2017 03:29:15 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, ah.
06 Aug 2017 03:29:31 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, the search for the black market is still going
06 Aug 2017 03:29:38 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, tiger is still trying to find it
06 Aug 2017 03:30:05 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, well if that's the case, I'm going to allow selling of iron but drastically nerf the price, like "4O" for a iron sell.
06 Aug 2017 03:30:22 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, if it doesn't let me, I'll just make a really low price but have it seem reasonable.
06 Aug 2017 03:30:43 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, im just gonna go to sleep
06 Aug 2017 03:31:21 : Legacy Craft, screenshots, DJ Small#8652, I did not see that weird looking mound the last time I was at spawn.

07 Aug 2017 04:07:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, **How to install**
1) Download this: https://limitlessmc.net/dl/limitlesspack%20v0.1.zip
2) Extract the zip to any location.
3) Run the forge installer within the folder.
4) Open the minecraft launcher and go to the **Launch Options** Toggle on **advanced settings** if you havent already and then click add a new profile, name said profile "limitless pack v0.1" so you'll remember this later. select the forge version that you just installed a few moments ago. and then enable and point the **Game directory** setting to the folder (the one you downloaded as a zip file. its named "limitlesspack v0.1") then enable **JVM arguments** and give minecraft atleast 2G of ram by changing -Xmx1G -> -Xmx2G

07 Aug 2017 18:35:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, oh so he's almost done with the modpack
07 Aug 2017 18:35:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, We r trying to figure out what to fix because since there is so many mods they sometimes clash with eachother
07 Aug 2017 18:36:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, ahh
07 Aug 2017 18:36:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, im checking the forums to see if theres anymore i could find out about
07 Aug 2017 18:37:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @Jay113355  also can agricraft be removed from the pack it keeps crashing me, its because some of the crops have the same id as other items

07 Aug 2017 18:39:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, oh lol
07 Aug 2017 18:39:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, The torch gun seems to crash the server xD
07 Aug 2017 18:39:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, I mean, Jay literally said that he just tossed a bunch of mods together
07 Aug 2017 18:39:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, sounds fun
07 Aug 2017 18:39:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, i think chunk loaders would be a bad idea
07 Aug 2017 18:39:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, and oh god baka no torch gun
07 Aug 2017 18:39:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @TherminatorX  exactly we gotta root out the bad mods
07 Aug 2017 18:40:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, unfortunately, i be moving back to college in few days
07 Aug 2017 18:40:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, There are no bad mod
07 Aug 2017 18:40:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, not the best time to start playing mc again
07 Aug 2017 18:40:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @Bakafish  nuuu
07 Aug 2017 18:40:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, for me
07 Aug 2017 18:40:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @TherminatorX  i mean the ones that clash with eachother and crash people
07 Aug 2017 18:40:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, i might hop on if there's spare time
07 Aug 2017 18:40:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Remove Optifine
07 Aug 2017 18:40:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, heh well i dont know my timescale yet for school especially now that im moving to a new one lol
07 Aug 2017 18:40:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Well jay is prob fixing the server rn from when it crashed
07 Aug 2017 18:41:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @TherminatorX  y optifine?
07 Aug 2017 18:41:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, hmm jay is going to have some fun
07 Aug 2017 18:41:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, and it sounds like theres going to be a ton of crashes
07 Aug 2017 18:42:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Optifine messes with vanilla rendering code, which a lot of mods rely on to properly display thier blocks and fancy things
07 Aug 2017 18:42:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, i dont think there will be that many
07 Aug 2017 18:42:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, chunk loaders can't be allowed even if they are in the mod
07 Aug 2017 18:43:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, You'd be surprised how many isssues are fixd bu not using it
07 Aug 2017 18:43:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, good
07 Aug 2017 18:43:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @TherminatorX  true but we gotta get rid of a mod like agricraft
07 Aug 2017 18:43:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, agricraft is in alpha and keeps crashing me xD
07 Aug 2017 18:43:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Agricraft is fine
07 Aug 2017 18:44:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, You just gotta use the right version

07 Aug 2017 18:53:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Multimc is messing with how mods are supposed to load
07 Aug 2017 18:53:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, U dun goofed
07 Aug 2017 18:53:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, thats the only mod causing the issue tho
07 Aug 2017 18:53:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Nope
07 Aug 2017 18:54:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, The only thing mentioned is multimc in that report

07 Aug 2017 18:55:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Oh
07 Aug 2017 18:56:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, And also all the core mods are blaming Optifine
07 Aug 2017 18:56:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, So u think it may be optifine too?
07 Aug 2017 18:56:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Optifine is known not to play well with NEI
07 Aug 2017 18:56:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, TherminatorX#6644, Been a thing for years

07 Aug 2017 19:32:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ModjaFur#0515, The covens mod is basically witchery that's been updated....
07 Aug 2017 19:32:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ηєяσкιη#3586, And it's skipping straight to 1.12
07 Aug 2017 19:33:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ηєяσкιη#3586, Not worth getting
07 Aug 2017 19:33:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, I wish there was morph mod in this pack
