29 Apr 2017 04:25:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so like @Mining_Zoroark you like Comedy a decent amount, but you don't like it when its with Supernatural
29 Apr 2017 04:25:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and you like it more than average when its with School
29 Apr 2017 04:25:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, Heh I can tell that Ghost in the shell weighed in heavily
29 Apr 2017 04:26:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and you like supernatural with ecchi 😉
29 Apr 2017 04:26:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Mining_Zoroark#8313, I think i just havnt seen many supernatural comedys
29 Apr 2017 04:27:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, And @(Not Really)Head Mod AlphaBit you like Drama, but not with Comedy, and you like Drama a lot when its with Supernatural
29 Apr 2017 04:28:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, my program takes in all of these combinations of genres

Elytras, mballs, expalls, dragon eggs, nether stars, do get bought, it's just a question about demand - bear in mind that mega bosses causes all of those items except master balls to drop within about a week so they're fairly common - and again, in such a small timeframe.

160 TMS but then you need the ones that count - I've got 30 Bide TMs but 0 Earthquakes. If I wanted an earthquake tm, I would have to spend several days hunting pokeloots for one move. 

2.5k isnt much in the grand scheme of things but they easily go for 3k and upwards, and also when you look at the average players' cash they're gonna be dropping most of it on a mball - prices of legends are near the same also, apart from the new legends.

7 people have 100k money or over - AussieAge and I are breeders, who have spent months breeding egg group pokemon to get to where we are, Userman's balance is hacked, IamLucario_ is a breeder and the first one on the list who sells boss loot, TurboX3dan has been MIA for a long time but another boss tower lad, MattRuc is a youtuber, and Bringer is our MIA admin who worked with Aussie as a breeder.
The fact that I, as a breeder, am still in business is proof that no not everyone has their dream team. If people did have more of their dream teams I'd like to ask them to fight mroe gyms/take more gyms.
People do have full pc boxes of legends, but those people would be AussieAge, who spent forever finding the perfect biome split, and others who didn't just have it in a day - theyve been working at it collecting them all year round. Legends are typically caught by these players with quick/dusk/ultra balls though and not mballs.

29 Apr 2017 07:08:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Adam#7575, Admittedly a lot of prices are low right now, but the issue with having higher prices is if evrything costs more...well, everything costs more and things are essentially the same. sure we could stick two zeroes on the end of your bal to make you feel good but then that stack of iron you want is gonna cost $30000 instead of $300. And lets say we keep some prices the same and raise others; that money has to come from somewhere. Many customers of mine struggle to afford the 3k or so i charge for 5iv/HA. If I raise this to 8k, i alienate 70% of my customers, and just open up the market to being sniped.

That said I was chatting to staff yesterday about the reset and how to promote the server upon reset to help boost numbers 😛 x

29 Apr 2017 08:28:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lean#1524, just wanted to state my opinion, 
I'm an old player here at limitless that started getting back again, only stopped due to shitty internet.
Started playing during 1.6.4 where majority of the players are cracked like me, since MC is expensive if you convert our currency to USD.
During my time, the server used to cap everyday, and it really was a pain to refresh every second to try and get in, but nonetheless it was fun playing with a lot of people.
I don't know when and why the server started using whitelist but I actually agree to remove the whitelist if we hard reset.
The main reason why i even started playing at limitless is because it was a cracked server, and as i played on through, the people were nice and the environment was really friendly which is why i stayed for a long time.
So I think, I would have to agree with  @7up  and @SuMiT , if we ever Update, we should hard reset and remove whitelist so cracked players can actually play again.
It wouldn't be a surprise if the server's rates would go up if we remove the whitelist.
29 Apr 2017 08:32:00 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, ik who killed him

29 Apr 2017 08:40:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lean#1524, Also, If you ever search for "Cracked Pixelmon Server" on google, you would find Limitless on one or more of the search results.
Meaning that Limitless was actually known for being a cracked server that a ton of people used to play, it doesn't matter if they're old players or new players, Everyone should be able to start fresh and new, even cracked players.
If we successfully did it back in 1.6.4, why can't we do it now? 
Sure there would be more players who break the rules like using all caps and griefing or using Xray but that's what the mods are here for.
I know it's bad to compare the Old with the New since there are a lot of changes, but as I am an old player, The first question that got into my mind was "Where the fuck is everyone?".
I wasn't used to the server only having 2-5 people online, I wasn't used to players only checking up on their pokes, hatching their eggs and immediately going off after that, you could say that i got a culture shock lol.
Since i was also a mod back in the day, we used to have 2-3 mods online just to take care of things and i would usually tell people "Watch your caps" every 3 minutes or so, and all the kids screaming out "Fuck lag" or "Lag!!" in the chat lmao.
Seeing that was actually the reason why i wanted to be a Mod in the first place.
29 Apr 2017 08:40:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lean#1524, But that's just my opinion, I'll take whatever will happen in the future.

29 Apr 2017 10:06:23 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, which is why someone made something that is totally wrong and it is easy to read
29 Apr 2017 10:07:12 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, do we need to sit and wait
29 Apr 2017 10:09:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, darth kota#9446, I'd love to see the server back in shaped tho we are a little empty rn but I'm sure we will pull through the server isn't much younger then Pixelmon only counting after it switch from faction and we have always managed to keep things decent I wasn't there for the whole thing but I've been around to know a little about the server and I'm sure we can do it
29 Apr 2017 10:10:07 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, i just got an idea
29 Apr 2017 10:10:50 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, if someone says u are something say that the people u win with are going to vote guilty to protect himself

29 Apr 2017 10:11:15 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, then they will obstain or inocent
29 Apr 2017 10:11:31 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, or just won't care and do guilty
29 Apr 2017 10:15:23 : Shadow's Subnautica, townofsalem, tigertiger02#4338, lol
29 Apr 2017 10:19:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, darth kota#9446, Ik this might be hard task but I think light and jay should focus on modifying things that make the player experience differ from other servers so we stand out tbh I came here for the economy because the others didn't allow cracked and then Pokémon was an added bonus I got more then I wanted couldnt have been better for me

29 Apr 2017 11:27:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lean#1524, @darth kota  it's fairly easy to see who's multi accounting or who has a brother or not, since i was a mod, i've IP banned a handful of people because of multi accounting. so it really isn't a problem that much.

29 Apr 2017 14:52:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, so jay places the whitelist requirement for cracked accounts to prevent aboose?
29 Apr 2017 14:53:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Crystal4209#4698, I think so
29 Apr 2017 14:53:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Crystal4209#4698, Anyway good night everyone

29 Apr 2017 14:53:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, perhaps making it clear
29 Apr 2017 14:53:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, that cracked accounts have to request whitelist status from jay on discord
29 Apr 2017 14:54:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, would help more new cracked players access the server
29 Apr 2017 15:01:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, then again, perhaps really letting the whitelist go next server iteration would be a better idea, as suggested already

29 Apr 2017 15:38:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, Exactly the reason Crystal had, but its not their opinions, its the fact they are so scared of a restart that isn't happening anytime soon.

29 Apr 2017 18:29:53 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, dick van lick#7498, he thinks that you're not dictonary definition 'trans' and therefore refuses to call you with genderfluid phrases

29 Apr 2017 18:32:23 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, dick van lick#7498, that's the main reason why everyone laughs at people saying there are more than two genders
29 Apr 2017 18:32:43 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, dick van lick#7498, because gender refers to sexual organs that define which gender you are
29 Apr 2017 18:32:49 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, navy#8336, o h
29 Apr 2017 18:32:57 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, navy#8336, sexual organs are called the sex

29 Apr 2017 18:33:41 : RooberBoobers, realtalk, dick van lick#7498, you can't really say that your gender is gay as that's not a physical organ which defines it
