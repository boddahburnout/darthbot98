31 Mar 2017 04:45:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, dont know how those two things happened but hey
31 Mar 2017 04:45:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, nope don't have a website atm xD

31 Mar 2017 04:52:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, but i have no way of seeing who has voted the most or how much people have voted
31 Mar 2017 04:52:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, true
31 Mar 2017 04:52:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, so kinda hard to find a stopping point
31 Mar 2017 04:52:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, i would say around 500
31 Mar 2017 04:52:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, that's what me and baka were talking about a while ago
31 Mar 2017 04:53:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, 500votes though man that's alot
31 Mar 2017 04:53:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, yeah

31 Mar 2017 04:53:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, i think people have stopped voting so much already though
31 Mar 2017 04:53:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, i might be adding back rare candys per vote
31 Mar 2017 04:53:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, soon

31 Mar 2017 04:58:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, i only eat ramen when i hate myself unless i go to jap resturant and get real ramen
31 Mar 2017 04:59:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, yes is there already a mod for it? or am i the only person who's thought it's needed
31 Mar 2017 04:59:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, me and chelsea went over the weekend and got beef curry and harumaki
31 Mar 2017 04:59:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, ;-; am poor after bills and saving for the move
31 Mar 2017 04:59:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, place is like 45 mins away tho
31 Mar 2017 04:59:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, isn't the pc represented by some type of data structure?
31 Mar 2017 04:59:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, like an array or hashmap of some sort
31 Mar 2017 04:59:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, LightBot#4090, Welcome @Sesu to LimitlessMc!
31 Mar 2017 04:59:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, array of sorts
31 Mar 2017 05:00:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, yeah its easy to call sort methods but
31 Mar 2017 05:00:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, it wont do much
31 Mar 2017 05:00:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, there are more complex sorts being suggested than can easily be done with arrays
31 Mar 2017 05:00:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, ?
31 Mar 2017 05:01:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, But like what would you sort by?
31 Mar 2017 05:01:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, ^ good question
31 Mar 2017 05:01:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, pene size bruh
31 Mar 2017 05:01:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, typing? i'vs? idk
31 Mar 2017 05:01:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, pokedex id is the only one i can think of
31 Mar 2017 05:01:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, ^ that'd be pretty neat imo
31 Mar 2017 05:02:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, but its not realy that helpful
31 Mar 2017 05:02:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, or level
31 Mar 2017 05:02:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, ?
31 Mar 2017 05:02:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, true
31 Mar 2017 05:04:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, alphabetical
31 Mar 2017 05:04:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, level (high to low) (low to high), pokedex number, size in smallest to largest(in pokedex then level order), largest to smallest(pokedex then level), (for traders) OT name
31 Mar 2017 05:05:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, complex system you got there
31 Mar 2017 05:06:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, i know but it's how i've otganized boxes before
31 Mar 2017 05:07:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, now my pixelmon pc is a mess like my chests
31 Mar 2017 05:09:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, one thing i've noticed on the server recently
31 Mar 2017 05:09:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, is how the amount of gym challenges made
31 Mar 2017 05:09:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, is virtually zero
31 Mar 2017 05:09:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, even when there are more people on
31 Mar 2017 05:10:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, no one kills themselves breeding anymore
31 Mar 2017 05:10:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, its destroys motivation
31 Mar 2017 05:10:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, people like gilman and toph screwed gym challenges for me
31 Mar 2017 05:11:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, does that mean we must make gyms ez?
31 Mar 2017 05:11:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, loool
31 Mar 2017 05:11:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, or perhaps add more "gym" content?
31 Mar 2017 05:11:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, the whole point of gyms is for them to not be easy
31 Mar 2017 05:11:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, le
31 Mar 2017 05:11:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, so there's a challenge
31 Mar 2017 05:12:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, but no people come to pursue it
31 Mar 2017 05:12:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, but recently people tend to cry alot when they don't/can't win
31 Mar 2017 05:12:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, im not saying make em easy
31 Mar 2017 05:13:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, maybe two leagues
31 Mar 2017 05:13:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, but still same thing
31 Mar 2017 05:13:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, people get stressed breeding end up killing em selves and get burnt out
31 Mar 2017 05:13:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, well a rule could be if the pokemon doesn't evolve before said level cap it can't be used
31 Mar 2017 05:13:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, that ruins ditto bred pokemon from being used
31 Mar 2017 05:14:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, and new people have difficult time handling such pokemon
31 Mar 2017 05:14:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, that's because not everyone has the time or luck to find a perfect iv pair of dittos
31 Mar 2017 05:16:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, custom npc gyms/buildings could be added as a way to train for official gyms?
31 Mar 2017 05:16:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, with a way of challenging more than the 2 a day limit
31 Mar 2017 05:17:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, i had an idea a while ago
31 Mar 2017 05:17:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, and a clone team of the actual leaders gym team
31 Mar 2017 05:17:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, where you'd pay some amount (item or money)
31 Mar 2017 05:17:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, to be matched up with a random npc trainer with a team of a specified level range
31 Mar 2017 05:17:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, or something
31 Mar 2017 05:18:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, is there any grinding areas? 😃
31 Mar 2017 05:19:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, currently no formal exp grinding areas per se as boss towers are disabled
31 Mar 2017 05:19:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, adding such areas could be an idea
31 Mar 2017 05:21:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, so any thoughts?
31 Mar 2017 05:21:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, yea sounds good
31 Mar 2017 05:21:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, i have a similar idea
31 Mar 2017 05:21:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, you could even add ev training areas for the poeple that like the competitive scene of pokemon aswell
31 Mar 2017 05:22:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, @Bakafish we have the noob garden maybe make an intermediate garden?
31 Mar 2017 05:22:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, maybe have a weekend thing where boss towers are enabled :dicDik:
31 Mar 2017 05:23:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, awww can't use emotes from twitch
31 Mar 2017 05:23:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, le
31 Mar 2017 05:24:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, considering you already have arena warps and stuff like that i'd recomend an ev training area
31 Mar 2017 05:24:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, we've had discussions about ev training are's in the past
31 Mar 2017 05:27:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, intermediate gardens could be cool
31 Mar 2017 05:27:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, but what pokemon to use
31 Mar 2017 05:27:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, is a good question
31 Mar 2017 05:27:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, good thinkin
31 Mar 2017 05:27:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, kek the evolved bugs? XDXD
31 Mar 2017 05:27:44 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, could work
31 Mar 2017 05:28:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, have them spawn at levels 35-50?
31 Mar 2017 05:28:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, sure
31 Mar 2017 05:29:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, butterfly, beedrill, beautifly, dustox?
31 Mar 2017 05:30:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, oh wait
31 Mar 2017 05:30:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, butterfree*
31 Mar 2017 05:30:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, lul
31 Mar 2017 05:30:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, i think ev training areas will be nice... the fact that you can spend alot of time on a pokemon to have it be really strong is really rewarding.. especially if u keep breeding till you get the right nature and iv's 😃
31 Mar 2017 05:30:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, wormadamnit
31 Mar 2017 05:31:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, noob garden provides ev training for speed (weedle) and HP (caterpie)
31 Mar 2017 05:31:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, hmm
31 Mar 2017 05:31:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, other stats would be neat for newer players
31 Mar 2017 05:31:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sesu#8520, speed ev's are very common but hp not so much 😛
31 Mar 2017 05:31:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, i have 6 of each type of pokemon to use for ev training i just have friends let me kill em
31 Mar 2017 05:32:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, i normally pay em or give em a poke
31 Mar 2017 05:32:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, ev training is pretty easy even with just one buddy
31 Mar 2017 05:32:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, now before berries that sucked ass
31 Mar 2017 05:32:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, and before /ev command

31 Mar 2017 05:35:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, better then having to keep track in a notebook
31 Mar 2017 05:35:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, it's gem cost or cooldown
31 Mar 2017 05:36:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Ankorzz#4034, gems require a diamond anyways since i can't farm bosses for them anymore
31 Mar 2017 05:38:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, diamonds are ez to get tho just get silk touch and fort 3 pick
31 Mar 2017 05:38:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, use one to stock ore other to bang it out
31 Mar 2017 05:38:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, ^ listen to tha master

31 Mar 2017 20:24:34 : Unity Of Nirvana, bot_chat, JustinOPGamer#9138, I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokemon to understand

Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
