28 Aug 2017 18:32:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, as an excuse
28 Aug 2017 18:33:23 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, For my stupid thing which i did
28 Aug 2017 18:34:33 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, oh so your saying you did it not your brother?
28 Aug 2017 18:34:48 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, i mean i did it by Mr Grrr
28 Aug 2017 18:34:55 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, and my brother by Mac
28 Aug 2017 18:35:17 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, But it's already over
28 Aug 2017 18:35:21 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, right so you did bypass claims and grief people
28 Aug 2017 18:35:27 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, which isn't what you said before
28 Aug 2017 18:35:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, only Mr Grrr
28 Aug 2017 18:35:37 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, righttttttt
28 Aug 2017 18:35:42 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, what my brother did
28 Aug 2017 18:35:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Which also means you lied in your appeal...
28 Aug 2017 18:36:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, and you lied to everyone in discord and on your appeal
28 Aug 2017 18:36:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, I didn´t write the appeal
28 Aug 2017 18:36:12 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, I wrote nothing
28 Aug 2017 18:36:18 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, But
28 Aug 2017 18:36:18 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Yes you did. It was your name on the appeal
28 Aug 2017 18:36:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, AaronFi149#6073, Yes because my brother has got acces to my Laptop
28 Aug 2017 18:36:43 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, I will be honest aaron where your lies start and where they end I don't know but I really have had enough of them
