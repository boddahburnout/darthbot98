11 Aug 2017 20:32:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, indeed that would be the easist way to do it
11 Aug 2017 20:32:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, not sure if anyone read the general config for this plugin but the way it breaks down the chance for each thing is it has tiers: common,rare and very rare
11 Aug 2017 20:33:05 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, I keep timing out on log in
11 Aug 2017 20:33:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so what I was thinking of doing if we incorporate this into the economy is have the common stuff be worth 50% of what you pay for the rare stuff 100% so you get your money back and the very rare to be like 200% or something to that effect
11 Aug 2017 20:34:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, what do you guys think to something like that @​everyone
11 Aug 2017 20:34:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, It is I
11 Aug 2017 20:34:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, obvs you get the free one to

11 Aug 2017 20:35:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, unfortunatly money isn't an option for a reward
11 Aug 2017 20:35:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, like the plugin just doesn't do it
11 Aug 2017 20:36:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, but it will do any items we tell it to do
11 Aug 2017 20:37:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I really need to make a to do list
11 Aug 2017 20:37:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, madmike99222#6535, mikes to do list:
11 Aug 2017 20:37:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, madmike99222#6535, 1. sort out the wheel of fortune plugin
11 Aug 2017 20:38:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, madmike99222#6535, 2.Sort out the wheel of fortune plugin
11 Aug 2017 20:38:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, madmike99222#6535, 3.Do a DE nerf
11 Aug 2017 20:39:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, madmike99222#6535, 4.Sort out skyfactory
11 Aug 2017 20:40:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, does any of this make sense to you @Long John Silver
11 Aug 2017 20:41:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, A little but not much
11 Aug 2017 20:43:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, lol okay so there is a wheel of fortune plugin we are going to get, players will get 2 rolls a day for  free doners will get more, you can get items from the wheel of fortune like ingots or diamonds what ever we decide and players can also use ingame money to roll more times
11 Aug 2017 20:44:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, it serves a few purposes 1. is a cash sink 2. more doner perks and 3. it is just kinda fun
11 Aug 2017 20:45:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, I still feel we need more ways to get cash
11 Aug 2017 20:45:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, well light is making us a pvp plugin so players can get cash via that
11 Aug 2017 20:45:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that will be a new way to get money
11 Aug 2017 20:46:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, @Pikadude1228
11 Aug 2017 20:46:52 : PokeIslands, general, Ram#1721, What is the newest beta in pixelmon reborn? I have beta 4
11 Aug 2017 20:46:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, cool
11 Aug 2017 20:47:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, beta5
11 Aug 2017 20:47:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, not sure what other ways you would want
11 Aug 2017 20:47:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, It's fine as long as it's not another MC server invite
11 Aug 2017 20:47:16 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, beta5 is the latest beta if i did hear correctly
11 Aug 2017 20:47:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Random discord invites and just annoying, but don't break the rules
11 Aug 2017 20:47:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, there is voting and selling and soon to be pvp
11 Aug 2017 20:47:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, we may be able to tie pve into that too but lets get to that when we get to that

12 Aug 2017 02:13:24 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, look at us
12 Aug 2017 02:13:29 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 40 cents for a key
12 Aug 2017 02:13:53 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, which makes it 80 cents for 2 keys
12 Aug 2017 02:14:03 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and you receive more out of the crates than you do at pokefiesta
12 Aug 2017 02:14:07 : PokeIslands, general, DarkfireTheGreat#7789, true
12 Aug 2017 02:15:22 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so i gues pokefiesta is quiet ripoff
12 Aug 2017 02:16:29 : PokeIslands, general, DarkfireTheGreat#7789, in the crates

12 Aug 2017 02:17:17 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, in the crate you get random shiny's which means even legends and rare candie and even more
12 Aug 2017 02:17:37 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 1 spinner crate = 40 cents and you get a shiny ez
12 Aug 2017 02:17:44 : PokeIslands, general, DarkfireTheGreat#7789, max ivs?
12 Aug 2017 02:17:50 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if you have luck yes

12 Aug 2017 17:55:53 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because from what I see, the server itself is performing fine with surplus memory available, the TPS is very stable at 20... I can't think what it could be

12 Aug 2017 21:58:33 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's not rftools fault it sucks
12 Aug 2017 21:58:51 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Anyway, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what the issue is because the server's not crashing, it's just hanging
12 Aug 2017 22:00:24 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, @Jimmy ive already found lead 😛
12 Aug 2017 22:00:43 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, who needs lead? xD
12 Aug 2017 22:01:27 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, And iron etc
12 Aug 2017 22:01:29 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, *Hopefully* resetting the rftools data files and giving the server slightly more RAM will prevent rftools from hanging it again
12 Aug 2017 22:01:33 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, diamonds can be found to

12 Aug 2017 23:18:14 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, you don't fight anything at the last part xD
12 Aug 2017 23:18:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, unless you're level 60+ or something so that you can straight kill the boss
12 Aug 2017 23:18:41 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, It won't let me near the boss
12 Aug 2017 23:18:46 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, but when you're that high you don't get any xp from the dungeon so theres no use doing the dungeon
12 Aug 2017 23:18:48 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, It blocks me
12 Aug 2017 23:18:57 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, there are pressure plates on the floor near the grass part

12 Aug 2017 23:20:53 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, how wannt stick?
12 Aug 2017 23:20:57 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, well usually, as you start the last part. the begining doesn't spawn that many, so spawn a general first thing so it can deal extra dmg in the beginning
12 Aug 2017 23:21:01 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, i love stick
12 Aug 2017 23:21:28 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, and spawn slayers (last one to the right) or the one to the left of a slayer, which guards you at the spawning area

13 Aug 2017 00:20:20 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, because you claimed the chunks before you built the house
13 Aug 2017 00:20:31 : Legacy Craft, general, DormantSolice#5007, so if its unclaimed it goes back to what it was when you claimed it
13 Aug 2017 00:20:31 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ Small#8652, @DormantSolice benbob needs his house reclaimed and you have worldedit.

13 Aug 2017 14:45:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, @Mike How is the timing out/general lag?
13 Aug 2017 14:45:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, hasn't been any more times out since I have come bacck on and lag seems non existent
13 Aug 2017 14:46:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so everything seems to be running as it should be
13 Aug 2017 14:46:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's being much more sensible with memory management and chunk loading now
13 Aug 2017 14:47:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Before our minimum was around 16G, now it's lying around 9G with 3 players on
13 Aug 2017 14:47:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, thats good
13 Aug 2017 14:47:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, very good indeed
13 Aug 2017 14:48:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mystery-crate-cratereloaded-free.861/
13 Aug 2017 14:48:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Also, take this
13 Aug 2017 14:48:43 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, Dude
13 Aug 2017 14:49:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, You can add /cr givekey (bla) (bla) (bla) to the voting thingy, and actually change the type of key they get depending on their rank, I think
13 Aug 2017 14:49:01 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, Im doing my Jon
13 Aug 2017 14:49:04 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, Job
13 Aug 2017 14:49:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So donators can get rarer item chances when they vote for a key
13 Aug 2017 14:49:21 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, Do you expect me to check apps every second
13 Aug 2017 14:50:12 : PokeIslands, admin, dragonbro0803#0985, I expect you to check them more frequently
13 Aug 2017 14:50:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, ah that looks really good thanks
13 Aug 2017 14:51:17 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, I check then every 10 hours. That is plenty
13 Aug 2017 14:51:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And the crates.yml file shows very customisable items/keys for each crate type you define
13 Aug 2017 14:51:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Hell, you can even have effects when opened
13 Aug 2017 14:51:30 : PokeIslands, admin, dragonbro0803#0985, ok, ill do your job for you then when you cant
13 Aug 2017 14:51:35 : PokeIslands, admin, Sleepy#3807, No
13 Aug 2017 14:51:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is really cool
13 Aug 2017 14:51:48 : PokeIslands, admin, dragonbro0803#0985, then do your job and accept my boy spuddy
13 Aug 2017 14:51:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But wait, what version is this again?
