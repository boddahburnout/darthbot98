10 Dec 2016 23:01:34 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, alright, well python is an object oriented language
10 Dec 2016 23:01:44 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, meaning, its based off of classes and methods
10 Dec 2016 23:01:57 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, simply speaking, classes are things, and methods are what the things do
10 Dec 2016 23:02:11 : LimitlessMc, botchat, ShadowJackyl#0282, otay
10 Dec 2016 23:02:45 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, For example, ```py
1 is an of the int class```
10 Dec 2016 23:02:59 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, all numbers are
10 Dec 2016 23:03:06 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ints also have methods
10 Dec 2016 23:03:24 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, for example ```py
1 + 1```
10 Dec 2016 23:03:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, is really the computer calling a method called `+` on the Int 1
