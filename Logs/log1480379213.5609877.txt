29 Nov 2016 04:11:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KapuDaKoopa#5843, one of my friends directed me towards this server and
29 Nov 2016 04:11:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KapuDaKoopa#5843, they told me they were appointed as a Helper recently
29 Nov 2016 04:12:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KapuDaKoopa#5843, not sure if they're even on this Discord server tbh
29 Nov 2016 04:13:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KapuDaKoopa#5843, now that I think about it I don't really know their MC username either xd
29 Nov 2016 04:16:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, KapuDaKoopa#5843, I guess I just wanted to confirm if it was true about the Helper stuff

29 Nov 2016 07:21:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Watching this rn
29 Nov 2016 07:21:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, https://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni
29 Nov 2016 07:21:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, then gonna watch the sequel
29 Nov 2016 07:21:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, ok
29 Nov 2016 07:21:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but I actually hate it, literally the worst
29 Nov 2016 07:21:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, then why are you watching it?
29 Nov 2016 07:22:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause its so good
29 Nov 2016 07:22:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, still the worst tho
29 Nov 2016 07:22:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, how is that possible
29 Nov 2016 07:22:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ```Watching Higurshi is like locking a group of happy people in a test chamber, only coming back to find they've hacked each other into a bloody mess. Its horrific, its shocking, and yet a part of you, cannot help but wonder, how did it happen?

The curiosity takes over... and so you repeat the experiment, knowing full well that those cute looking teenagers you just sent are going to end up as bloody pulps. But hey, at least each time they die, you're one step closer to figuring out why they died, it's all good.

Higurashi essentially places you in the role of the scientist. It divides itself into several arcs, each of which begin exactly the same. A teenager moves into a remote countryside village, and befriends a group of sweet fangirls that could have come out right from a harem rom/com. Then, explicably, thing go wrong... very wrong. ```
29 Nov 2016 07:23:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, thats a review of it, sums it up nicely
29 Nov 2016 07:23:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, they just die again and again and again
29 Nov 2016 07:23:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and its terrible
29 Nov 2016 07:23:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, then they start all over again, from a different perspective
29 Nov 2016 07:23:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, or change the events a little
29 Nov 2016 07:23:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but its really cool, you learn more things everytime
29 Nov 2016 07:24:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, they you get attached to the characters again
29 Nov 2016 07:24:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and then...
29 Nov 2016 07:24:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, they kill em
29 Nov 2016 07:24:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, actually terrible
29 Nov 2016 07:24:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, 26 episodes doesnt sound to long might watch it myself
29 Nov 2016 07:24:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its pretty good
29 Nov 2016 07:24:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, there is a sequel too
29 Nov 2016 07:24:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but v scary
29 Nov 2016 07:25:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and kinda graphic, not too bad tho, but still v v creepy
29 Nov 2016 07:25:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, ok i will keep that in mind
29 Nov 2016 07:26:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its actually the worst tho xD Cause since it starts over again and again, you end up with a climax episode where people go mad, people get horribly slaughtered and killed, and then immediatly you have a super happy episode where everyone is just living a normal life, cause its a new arc, and none of that happened
29 Nov 2016 07:27:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but you remember, and you just look at all the happy people and think "They are all gonna die in like 3 episodes tops"
29 Nov 2016 07:28:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, lol sounds like a good anime to me xD
29 Nov 2016 07:28:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, like i said, its terrible, but amazing
29 Nov 2016 07:28:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, makes sense
29 Nov 2016 07:28:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, crystal4209#4698, true thanks for explaining it to me
29 Nov 2016 07:30:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, hmm, does ;image work yet?
29 Nov 2016 07:30:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ;image
