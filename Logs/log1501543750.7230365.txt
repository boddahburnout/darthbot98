31 Jul 2017 23:34:43 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, and now his parents are gonna be replacing my VGA port and possibly damages to the VGA driver and the keys.
31 Jul 2017 23:34:51 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, cause he was slamming on my keyboard
31 Jul 2017 23:34:53 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, my uncle is off the internet so i'm actually able to download things

31 Jul 2017 23:39:57 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, please keep it legal lads
31 Jul 2017 23:40:09 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, lolis weird me out

31 Jul 2017 23:40:53 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, is it really legal though?
31 Jul 2017 23:41:04 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, well it is animated actually
31 Jul 2017 23:41:16 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, so surely it is legal no matter what you do
31 Jul 2017 23:41:24 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, cause you'd be arrested and have to explain, "look ok i know she looks 12 but she's 18"
31 Jul 2017 23:41:25 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, I'm a TA for a Speech class
31 Jul 2017 23:41:38 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, and this devil kid was screwing up my computer
31 Jul 2017 23:41:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, @Light  please help
31 Jul 2017 23:41:50 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, even though I take notes for essentially the whole class
31 Jul 2017 23:42:11 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, hey they're the one with 1tb full of it
31 Jul 2017 23:42:12 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, now the VGA port is damaged and the drivers might be fukd up too
31 Jul 2017 23:42:27 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, i have over 40tb of code
31 Jul 2017 23:42:35 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, i have a gf i don't need porn
31 Jul 2017 23:42:51 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, the fuck needs 40tb of code
31 Jul 2017 23:42:59 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, that is a valid point
31 Jul 2017 23:43:00 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, i'm a programer
31 Jul 2017 23:43:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, :L
31 Jul 2017 23:43:10 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, can you make Paint a thing again?
31 Jul 2017 23:43:29 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, I know but like what 1 program needs 40 tb of code?
31 Jul 2017 23:43:32 : Legacy Craft, general, DeMadViper#5977, ouch
31 Jul 2017 23:43:49 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SkullShiner#0236, the best game ever
31 Jul 2017 23:44:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, snake?
31 Jul 2017 23:44:19 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, donkey cong country?
31 Jul 2017 23:44:24 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, the visible damage is that some keys are a bit stuck...
31 Jul 2017 23:44:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, tell me when I get it
31 Jul 2017 23:44:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, skull
31 Jul 2017 23:44:41 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, leading to poorer note-taking skills because some keys might literally be "sticky"
31 Jul 2017 23:45:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, runescape stuff
31 Jul 2017 23:45:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, mc stuff
31 Jul 2017 23:45:03 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, when I get my new razer, I think it's heavy enough that if someone decided to pull a shit on me I could club them with it.
31 Jul 2017 23:45:20 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, oh you code for runescape, I used to love that game
31 Jul 2017 23:45:38 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, what do you code runescape wise?
31 Jul 2017 23:45:41 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, I don't use the eSata but if and when I do it'll probably be fucked too
31 Jul 2017 23:46:22 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, my own private server and osrs
31 Jul 2017 23:46:27 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, I hope it'll still work with my second screen - if it doesn't that means the VGA boards are fucked and I'm essentially going to have to get a new computer
31 Jul 2017 23:47:12 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, thats cool, I am personally a runescape 3 guy myself but you can't forget the classic that is osrs
31 Jul 2017 23:47:19 : Legacy Craft, general, DJ Small#8652, as much as I want him to pay more because of damages to my computer, I also just hope it's a minor scratch that can be refixed by soldering rather than a whole mess that could leave my computer dead.
31 Jul 2017 23:51:51 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Lightning#6734, i quit rs3 after getting the comp cape
31 Jul 2017 23:52:48 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, fair enough that is a good goal to go for, I haven't played runescape in ages

01 Aug 2017 02:10:22 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, Star is Basically Garbage
01 Aug 2017 02:10:27 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Star#0288, ahhh just like normal
01 Aug 2017 02:11:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, i wonder what mods are going to be on that pack
01 Aug 2017 02:11:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, cant be anything huge like orespawn tho
01 Aug 2017 02:14:41 : Cipher, general, JustinOPGamer#9138, Jay is prob gonna add his own touch to the packs aswell
01 Aug 2017 02:14:45 : Cipher, general, JustinOPGamer#9138, which is gonna be awesome
01 Aug 2017 02:15:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, he will mostliky start small with mods first so many people can run it and play
01 Aug 2017 02:16:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, then slowly upgrade the mods to have more or make them better
01 Aug 2017 02:16:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, well that makes sense
01 Aug 2017 02:16:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, but i wonder what mods
01 Aug 2017 02:16:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, i have a good idea on some of them
01 Aug 2017 02:17:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, optifin
01 Aug 2017 02:17:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, something pixelmon needed iron chests
01 Aug 2017 02:17:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, so you dont have like 100000 chests laying around
01 Aug 2017 02:17:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @Jay113355  thats good, what about a minimap?
01 Aug 2017 02:17:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, like xernos or something
01 Aug 2017 02:18:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, i use that minimap it works great
01 Aug 2017 02:18:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, and has tons of versions
01 Aug 2017 02:19:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Jay do u know whether its gonna be a survival or like factions or something like that yet or nah
01 Aug 2017 02:19:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, i hope its not factions but thats my opinion
01 Aug 2017 02:19:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, factions is just a way to lose friends and have a ton of destruction around spawn
01 Aug 2017 02:20:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Well there r different types of factions
01 Aug 2017 02:21:04 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I am back from the doctors
01 Aug 2017 02:21:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Like some that u buy a plot and junk but true true
01 Aug 2017 02:21:44 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, @maddog780ca
01 Aug 2017 02:21:53 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, hey alright so I am back and umm
01 Aug 2017 02:21:57 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, some good and bad news
01 Aug 2017 02:22:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, but we must see what jay is willing to do since he will be running the mods and making the pack
01 Aug 2017 02:22:26 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, we have paper work to fill out for my insurance so i will just have give and hope they accept.
01 Aug 2017 02:22:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, true
01 Aug 2017 02:22:55 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, bad news is idk if i have diabetes yet all I got was a few test done and have to get more done so uggg
01 Aug 2017 02:23:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, all my friends that i played with havent voted on what jay said in the news but they said they would be happy to rejoin
01 Aug 2017 02:23:18 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, i will be gone about every 2 weeks I will leave for 1 day
01 Aug 2017 02:23:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, yea most people left the discord as soon as the server went down

01 Aug 2017 02:23:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, im pretty sure most would join back
01 Aug 2017 02:24:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, im surprised the discord didn't go down as a whole
01 Aug 2017 02:24:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, when i found out that the server was shut down i checked the discord
01 Aug 2017 02:24:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, well limitless is LIMITLESS so y would it go down?
01 Aug 2017 02:24:39 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, lol

01 Aug 2017 02:26:37 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I may have a cyst on my foot I have notice last year I started having a lump on my foot and they just took an xray to make sure it isnt attach to my bone
01 Aug 2017 02:26:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, knowing jay it will be fun
01 Aug 2017 02:27:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, the reason pixelmon died down on limitless is because there really wasn't much left to do
01 Aug 2017 02:27:05 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I will also be having surgery idk when yet have to make an appointment for it. SO YAY ME.

01 Aug 2017 02:27:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, thats y people started to leave
01 Aug 2017 02:27:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, yeah even i started to rarely come on
01 Aug 2017 02:28:58 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, I did get blood work done for testing so everyone wish me luck for no diabetes
01 Aug 2017 02:29:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, but something that will make my friends happy and maybe some other people is just one crazy stupid mod added in the middle of everything
01 Aug 2017 02:29:17 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, maddog780ca#9376, i hope for the best
01 Aug 2017 02:29:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Star#0288, like skyfactory how to use your dirtchest 9000 you place it and get that book and storage space

01 Aug 2017 09:10:54 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, 2. Don't raid bases if they are on the edge of a claim for example if a player can't claim there whole base yet don't raid the unclaimed bit.
01 Aug 2017 09:11:20 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, This is why donating to get more claim blocks is a perk
01 Aug 2017 09:11:52 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Rules seem a bit unenforceable and overreaching
01 Aug 2017 09:12:43 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, E.g. someone raids, person reclaims half their base and gets them banned
01 Aug 2017 09:16:38 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, If we're not stringent on the unclaimed=fair game rule, that's when people stop caring about protecting their property

01 Aug 2017 09:23:17 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I mean, if anything, it's just made it more confusing when it really didn't need to be. When I said raiding rules, I meant as far as staff getting involved - not changing a system which has worked well for nearly a year

01 Aug 2017 10:29:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, Ozicarus#8421, So we can't roll back with prism and take the backup of your inventory from 11 hours ago?
01 Aug 2017 10:30:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_general, Ozicarus#8421, Because that seems easier

01 Aug 2017 10:38:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Like my brother raids bases that are past the 30 days mark, thats fair enough bc the player hasnt been on, but admin bases and such should not be touched because they are in the staff group correct? Or does it apply to staff?
01 Aug 2017 10:38:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, The 30 day thing
01 Aug 2017 10:39:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Sacramentum#8702, @LolopFace  yo
01 Aug 2017 10:39:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Admin bases can still be raided, I expect staff to be smart...
01 Aug 2017 10:39:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Admins can use regions, anyway - they never expire
01 Aug 2017 10:40:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Okay good to hear
01 Aug 2017 10:40:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Yes we cant let that happen... moqt items could be spawned in so

01 Aug 2017 14:05:05 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, what about simply say: "dont take anything that was obviously crafted by another player"
01 Aug 2017 14:07:57 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because that's equivalent to 'Don't grief, full stop' - which is an ineffectual rule which results in no incentive for people to protect their stuff, leading to more incidents of griefing, leading to more bans - which isn't a good thing
01 Aug 2017 14:08:33 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, We used to do that on our old Tekkit server, we had probably 20+ bans a week just for griefing
01 Aug 2017 14:08:40 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, ho about if ya find a base ask a staff member
01 Aug 2017 14:08:46 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, how
01 Aug 2017 14:08:48 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And that's just a pain in the arse
01 Aug 2017 14:09:13 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Mr Grrr#1532, theyll probably know whos active etc
01 Aug 2017 14:10:00 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, My point being - it's worked fine for a very long time, this has come to attention because a staff member decided to help someone raid a base - sure, I think there should be rules about staff getting involved in that kind of stuff because they're expected to be 'above' that
01 Aug 2017 14:10:11 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But for regular players, I think it's all rather pointless and will cause more problems than it will solve
01 Aug 2017 14:10:49 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Basically trying to fix a problem which doesn't exist

01 Aug 2017 19:06:05 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Jimmy#4999, if you "clean" a base like tunis did, you cant use the land after xD
01 Aug 2017 19:08:37 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, "but if it's a base of someone not gone gone then it just causes anger" - Yes, which is the entire point. They protect their property, or it gets destroyed. It encourages people to actually put some effort in to protecting their stuff, or they take it for granted that whoever griefs them will just get banned anyway
01 Aug 2017 19:08:37 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, What did my brother do Jimmy?
01 Aug 2017 19:09:45 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Sorry isnt it allowed to raid a base if it past the 30 days mark?
01 Aug 2017 19:09:55 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yes
01 Aug 2017 19:10:43 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But Mike's bought in some exhaustive rules which I think are far too strict and hard to enforce - and i've already gone over why
01 Aug 2017 19:11:06 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Did he get banned for it?
01 Aug 2017 19:11:28 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I don't know anything about the tunis thing
01 Aug 2017 19:11:33 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Ohh alright
01 Aug 2017 19:11:37 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I don't think anyone's been banned under these new rules yet
01 Aug 2017 19:11:44 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Okay
01 Aug 2017 19:12:30 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But yeah, need I mention yet again *the only reason these rules have even been put up was because a mod helped someone to raid a property, and there was no rule in place to say he couldn't do that*
01 Aug 2017 19:12:46 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, ohhhhh

03 Aug 2017 02:58:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, The first way we did mixed mode was we had the server attempt to use premium auth the first time a user joins

03 Aug 2017 02:59:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, and if it failed(the user being cracked) then the server would mark them as a cracked user and auth them with the /login method
03 Aug 2017 03:00:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, It had alot of false positives. Some Premium users session expired before they tried to join limitless and it caused them to be marked as cracked thus breaking their skin and other features
03 Aug 2017 03:01:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, It was a mess to fix so i locked all new people joining to being premium and "whitelisted" all new cracked players
03 Aug 2017 03:01:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, that worked out much better

03 Aug 2017 03:02:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, I think this time ill do the same thing only instead of using the database and making users as premium vs cracked ill just have a list sort of like the bans list that will simply contain the names of all cracked players
03 Aug 2017 03:02:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Jay113355#4999, and it will asume all other players as premium
