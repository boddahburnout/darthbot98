23 Aug 2017 17:58:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well the highest package they can give is like 200mb max or something like that
23 Aug 2017 17:58:48 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i cant tell for sure but we are using 5 pcs and 3-4 Tables + 5 phones
23 Aug 2017 17:59:07 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Hmmm
23 Aug 2017 17:59:08 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, okay

23 Aug 2017 18:02:19 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, So, about the idea of a modpack...
23 Aug 2017 18:02:39 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i love these reactions xD
23 Aug 2017 18:02:49 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, I want to do an adventure map. (Not as the whole server obviously.) which means I need CustomNPCs. 😉
23 Aug 2017 18:03:17 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i don't go anywhere near stewie and the moment he says that stewie is infront of em xD
23 Aug 2017 18:03:57 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, You should look in the staff chat.
23 Aug 2017 18:04:55 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 😃 peeps won't be using custom npc's on my server aslong as i don't have perms to add it :/
23 Aug 2017 18:05:16 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, Wait what do you mean?
23 Aug 2017 18:05:31 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, Do you mean in game or not addable to the server? XD
23 Aug 2017 18:06:38 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, not addable to our pixelmon server
23 Aug 2017 18:06:44 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, untill deku gives me perms 😉
23 Aug 2017 18:07:11 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, Well, you see. Deku has no power over the modpack If I make it. XD
23 Aug 2017 18:07:20 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, I'm evil. >:)
23 Aug 2017 18:07:51 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, what i mean is you can make a modpack but aslong as i don't add it to the server peeps won't be able to use it lel
23 Aug 2017 18:09:07 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, Yea true. It will sit there inactive for people who join with it on your end.
23 Aug 2017 18:09:08 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, BUT
23 Aug 2017 18:09:30 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, You could use the fact that it is in the modpack as an excuse to add it.
23 Aug 2017 18:09:35 : PokeIslands, staff, AuroranLily#3763, >:)

23 Aug 2017 19:18:29 : Legacy Craft, admin, DormantSolice#5007, and to defuse time consumption, should there only be certain buildings of the old spawns, or all buildings without random ground chunks
23 Aug 2017 19:20:29 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ_Phatzo#8045, uploading the old 1.8 world
