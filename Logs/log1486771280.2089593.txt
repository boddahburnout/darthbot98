11 Feb 2017 05:11:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Chesire Kat#7022, well having an "public" bosstower is going to cause troubles for the staff seeing as they cause fights that the staff have to deal with that could be avoided by leaving it as is, so what i would recomend is that you get like 400$ buy 4 chunks and request again when you are in a position to claim it

11 Feb 2017 06:52:26 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, AngelWarrior73#4716, Sort of. Not allowed to watch it very often coz parents don't like it
11 Feb 2017 06:52:42 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, ruleroftri#6648, Why? It's the most harmless show ever
11 Feb 2017 06:52:52 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, AngelWarrior73#4716, They don't like anime
11 Feb 2017 06:53:04 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, ruleroftri#6648, Why? Because it's cool?
11 Feb 2017 06:53:15 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, AngelWarrior73#4716, They say it's crap

11 Feb 2017 06:54:40 : Unity Of Nirvana, general, ruleroftri#6648, Anime is over the top, you can't recreate an action scene from anime into real life, it doesn't work many have tried none have succeeded, look at dragon ball evolution or the last airbender
