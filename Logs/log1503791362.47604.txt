27 Aug 2017 16:28:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, okay so @​everyone currently the voting rewards as follows, everytime 250$ and 2 common lootbags as for lucky rewards, rare is either 16 common loot bags or 500$ cash epic is 32 common loot bags or 1000$ cash and legendary is 64 common loot bags, before this is finalised anyone have any opinions
27 Aug 2017 16:28:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, Lit
27 Aug 2017 16:28:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, nothing you would change jj?
27 Aug 2017 16:29:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Jimmy#4999, isnt skyfactory an extra hard mod? I mean, better give less money than in ftb
27 Aug 2017 16:29:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, @jjtwilefc
27 Aug 2017 16:29:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well items would be worth more?
27 Aug 2017 16:29:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Jimmy#4999, no i mean money, for 500 a day you can buy very much...
27 Aug 2017 16:29:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, Nothing really
27 Aug 2017 16:29:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well that depends on the players
27 Aug 2017 16:30:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, if we as players decide 500 is worth a stack of cobble then 500 ain't worth much at all
27 Aug 2017 16:30:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, the economy is all up to the players
27 Aug 2017 16:30:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, these can be changed later if 500 ends up being worth a lot
27 Aug 2017 16:31:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but we need to establish an economy before we know
27 Aug 2017 16:31:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Jimmy#4999, oh yeah....my bad, i thought of the same prices as for IE
27 Aug 2017 16:32:00 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, hey karu how r u doing
27 Aug 2017 16:32:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, ohhhh, no they will definatly not be the same
27 Aug 2017 16:32:15 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, will u be coming back to legacy
27 Aug 2017 16:33:17 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, karu?
27 Aug 2017 16:33:38 : Legacy Craft, general, subzero69#9175, i would hope u come back to legacy
27 Aug 2017 16:34:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, It's up to the starting players on how the economy is.
27 Aug 2017 16:35:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, indeed it is
27 Aug 2017 16:35:25 : PokeIslands, bot, KiritoSanPlays#2208, uploading the new mod now 😃
27 Aug 2017 16:37:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, I think the voting rewards sound good
27 Aug 2017 16:38:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, okay cool, that is now all the voting rewards done then
27 Aug 2017 16:38:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I have set the chances of getting basically the same as IE
27 Aug 2017 16:38:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535,

And Im sure it will be big one day. Anyways, if you think im causing you 'problems' by reporting these players, feel free to ban me. I only join this server of yours as im a newbie to pixelmon Modpack as i thought it would be noob-welcoming, you also seem like a nice owner. so yeah. That's what i have to say. Other than that expect me to be on this server daily.
He basicly was trying to make me look like the bad guy, i dont really see how im 'Favored' by the helper catching the legendary pokemon I FOUND On my own but i couldnt catch as it was glitched
I only used common sense to report the guy for swearing, ect
Its just common on almost every server that you should never disrespect staff either members.
He was also cyber bullying me, wich is just. sad.
You shouldn't be angry at all, he just came back to discord to get salty and ruin your day. you did the right thing. if you think im just causing you problems, then you can just ban me.
