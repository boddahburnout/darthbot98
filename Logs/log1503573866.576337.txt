24 Aug 2017 12:08:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, Yeah
24 Aug 2017 12:08:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, shuck#1142, Idk what ya on about
24 Aug 2017 12:08:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, As a staffs point of view I'd say yes, but as someone who plays I'd say no cos I've put so much work into it 😂😂
24 Aug 2017 12:08:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Macomplete#2338, Oohw, i didn't think of a reset though...
24 Aug 2017 12:08:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Macomplete#2338, Fack 😄

24 Aug 2017 12:08:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I've just finished up the basic interior of spawn
24 Aug 2017 12:09:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, There's the towers and upper floors but I cba, there's no point
24 Aug 2017 12:09:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, They can be used for donator areas or something
24 Aug 2017 12:09:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Or parkour
24 Aug 2017 12:09:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, Okay we need to get this in a state ready to launch then ASAP
24 Aug 2017 12:09:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Do da pluginz
24 Aug 2017 12:09:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Gyrkkus#9461, I believe that deleting the islands is a good idea
24 Aug 2017 12:09:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, I'll be on in a couple of hours to get some stuff done. Got stuff irk to do
24 Aug 2017 12:10:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jd#0572, Could you delete the islands#
24 Aug 2017 12:10:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, Okay then, time to like no life setting up this server then
24 Aug 2017 12:15:03 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, @Kirito How is your server still down?
24 Aug 2017 12:15:06 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, :/
24 Aug 2017 12:16:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, It would be nice for everyone to get an even start
24 Aug 2017 12:17:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, That would drive competition a lot
24 Aug 2017 12:17:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well I was going to propose we give the testers a little advantage as some of them have put many hours into this already
24 Aug 2017 12:17:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, jjtwilefc#7374, Yeah I guess
24 Aug 2017 12:17:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I kinda feel like seeing as people have put many hours into they should get something

24 Aug 2017 12:23:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, pretty sure we've collectively broken 15 spawners and no one got any broken spawners yet

24 Aug 2017 15:02:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @7up  chances r very low
24 Aug 2017 15:02:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, like im guessing less than 1%

24 Aug 2017 15:02:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, so might aswell try to not mine them
24 Aug 2017 15:02:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, i think a 50% drop rate would be fair
24 Aug 2017 15:02:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, no
24 Aug 2017 15:02:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, did you guys get any?
24 Aug 2017 15:02:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, i think like a 5% since there is so many
24 Aug 2017 15:03:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, and no
24 Aug 2017 15:03:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, 5% !? thats 1/20 spawners
24 Aug 2017 15:03:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, 7up#2378, spawners are already so hard to find
24 Aug 2017 15:03:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, not if u find one of the mineshafts

24 Aug 2017 18:49:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its better to just limit the mod cap, instead of limiting the thing giving people them

24 Aug 2017 18:52:06 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, sounds good 😄
24 Aug 2017 18:52:21 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, for the bot to detect the emojis like ❤  or 🔥 and then be able to play back all the songs that you put that emoji on
24 Aug 2017 18:52:24 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like a personal playlist

24 Aug 2017 18:52:36 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, jjtwilefc#7374, Eggplant playlist
24 Aug 2017 18:52:37 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, oh wert question for you, are you able to make it so you can choose what icon the bot has so you can like white or black list diffrent icons
24 Aug 2017 18:52:44 : PokeIslands, bot, AuroranLily#3763, Wo
24 Aug 2017 18:53:03 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I was going to do a fresh set of icons soon
24 Aug 2017 18:53:09 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, just havent gotten around to it
24 Aug 2017 18:53:20 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, well that way diffrent discords could customise
24 Aug 2017 18:53:24 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and cant realy set them by server
24 Aug 2017 18:53:29 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause an icon is member based
24 Aug 2017 18:53:36 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, thats a shame
24 Aug 2017 18:53:36 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like you can't have 2 diff icons for 2 diff srever xD
24 Aug 2017 18:53:59 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, yeah I know that, that is why I was wondering if servers could then white/black list icons
24 Aug 2017 18:54:06 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, jjtwilefc#7374, We have some weebaphobes in this server
24 Aug 2017 18:54:12 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Light#6734, L
24 Aug 2017 18:54:18 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, so they still exist on the bot just not on the individual discord server
24 Aug 2017 18:54:56 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, I don't code at all so that may sound super dumb

24 Aug 2017 18:55:18 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I can't have the bot have a diff icon for diff servers, its a static icon, so once its set for the bot, its there for every server. I can't have it say don't show on this server, its not a coding thing, its a thing that discord doesnt support xD
24 Aug 2017 18:55:37 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, ahhhh thats a shame
24 Aug 2017 18:55:53 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, Light#6734, the devs do continue to change things soo
24 Aug 2017 18:56:39 : Proton Gaming Network, bot_commands, madmike99222#6535, yeah because as much as I enjoy anime not sure if they are the best thing for bot icons 😛

24 Aug 2017 21:16:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Aaron broadcasted a part of the glitch in global chat
24 Aug 2017 21:16:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Is that a banable offense
24 Aug 2017 21:17:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, We also do not know if he used it before
24 Aug 2017 21:17:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, Considering his past as a base raider, and the fact that he is the one who first brought it to our attention, it is a possibility to consider
24 Aug 2017 21:18:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, The question is, why would he say it in all chat?
24 Aug 2017 21:23:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, @Mike Depending on what I need to do beyond prism, buycraft and voting - and also depending on when I have a moment to do it - I guess a day or two?
24 Aug 2017 21:23:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It would be much quicker if I had someone write out a description for the server, the rules, and take some pictures for me
24 Aug 2017 21:24:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Also a features list
24 Aug 2017 21:24:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Pikadude1228#0109, Oder? For pics
24 Aug 2017 21:24:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, Either way, I confirm that the glitch works on claimed chests. In addition to this, one can also break machines using the network tool's "universal wrench" feature
24 Aug 2017 21:24:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, Okay because I reckon I should be able to do those config and stuff on the Google doc by the end of Saturday
24 Aug 2017 21:24:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Did you do nucleus and GP?
24 Aug 2017 21:24:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, Not yet
24 Aug 2017 21:24:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, Anything a wrench may be used on can be taken using the network manager
24 Aug 2017 21:25:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I reckon I do those tomorrow and Saturday
24 Aug 2017 21:25:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, That and mod config are the only big things I have left to do

24 Aug 2017 21:27:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, He just said "I found a glitch. The network tool can break blocks in other claims"
24 Aug 2017 21:27:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I would like to try and launch on either Sunday or Monday as a goal
24 Aug 2017 21:27:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Do what the police do when they don't have great grounds for prosecution

24 Aug 2017 21:27:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Sprinkle some crack on him and kick him about a bit
24 Aug 2017 21:27:48 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, Or like this weekend

24 Aug 2017 21:27:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Shoot him?
24 Aug 2017 21:28:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Just show him that we don't like what he's done, but in a super passive aggressive way
24 Aug 2017 21:28:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because that's sure to end well
24 Aug 2017 21:29:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Sunday is not a good day to launch
24 Aug 2017 21:29:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Next weekend is a bit shit because it's the first weekend of term for a lot of kids
24 Aug 2017 21:29:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, British police are different I guess
24 Aug 2017 21:29:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I guess maybe Friday morning would be good
24 Aug 2017 21:30:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, But yeah, can we ban the network tool? @​here
24 Aug 2017 21:30:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, No idea
24 Aug 2017 21:31:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, It doesn't have any major role so you probably can
24 Aug 2017 21:31:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, Ban the tool and administer some punishment for the fact that he disclosed a potentially major glitch
24 Aug 2017 21:32:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Gyrkkus#9461, ?
24 Aug 2017 21:32:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, How much money does he have in his account?
24 Aug 2017 21:33:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, It's not totally essential
24 Aug 2017 21:33:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, What's his username?

24 Aug 2017 21:34:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I fined him $2500
24 Aug 2017 21:34:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So he's now -1000
24 Aug 2017 21:34:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Haha
24 Aug 2017 21:34:35 : Achievement Heaven, pictures-snapshots-and-art, tigertiger02#4338, I just noticed my name
24 Aug 2017 21:34:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Today is not his day
24 Aug 2017 21:34:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, He had his inventory reset earlier cause it got corrupted
24 Aug 2017 21:35:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I sent him a message too
24 Aug 2017 21:35:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Well, he needs to not be a prick
24 Aug 2017 21:35:47 : Achievement Heaven, pictures-snapshots-and-art, GamerKatland#1817, lol where do you live tiger?
24 Aug 2017 21:35:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So now he can spend a little while getting back up to $0 so he can spend money again
24 Aug 2017 21:36:05 : Achievement Heaven, pictures-snapshots-and-art, tigertiger02#4338, Scotland of course
24 Aug 2017 21:36:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I don't think it really matters to much the day, I think earlier is better in this case
24 Aug 2017 21:36:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, As for the network tool, I think we should ban it for the time being and see if anyone kicks up a fuss
24 Aug 2017 21:36:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Anyone got the item ID?

24 Aug 2017 21:46:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, No, I would've had the same amount of work for SF2.5
24 Aug 2017 21:46:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Prism, Buycraft, Votifier are per-server
24 Aug 2017 21:47:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Website/voting sites are per-server

25 Aug 2017 18:48:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Can we accept Bastis appeal
25 Aug 2017 18:48:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I don't think he had anything to do with the griefing
25 Aug 2017 18:51:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, I think we should leave that to someone with, what is it, prism? let them see if he participated
25 Aug 2017 18:51:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i agree with pika
25 Aug 2017 18:52:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, So us mods and lower can only base our knowledge off of what we've heard/read
25 Aug 2017 18:53:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, If I recall what @Macomplete both aron and commander basti produced prism logs from raiding
25 Aug 2017 18:54:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I think Aaron's story could be true
25 Aug 2017 18:54:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Emphasis on Couls be
25 Aug 2017 18:54:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, about it being his brother?
25 Aug 2017 18:54:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Yes
25 Aug 2017 18:54:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, The same thing happened to me once
25 Aug 2017 18:54:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, It could also be a crock of shit
25 Aug 2017 18:54:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I think it's prob a crock of shot
25 Aug 2017 18:54:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, I have 2 brothers and niether has ever touched my account
25 Aug 2017 18:54:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, ok, im gnna be straight here, ive used that tactic to get away with griefing before, back in the days.

25 Aug 2017 18:55:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I really don't think anyone would be stupid enough to steal from mac just saying

25 Aug 2017 18:56:48 : Legacy Craft, admin, DJ_Phatzo#8045, 40 levels
300 radius
2,109,627 block of stone

Still... going...
25 Aug 2017 18:59:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Correction @mike and @Pikadude1228  the logs showed aaron took all the drives but he confessed Commander took some stuff as well that i didn't find yet, probably at someone else his base
25 Aug 2017 19:00:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, TBF Mac, I said that I couldn't speak on either part
25 Aug 2017 19:00:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Mac a couple other bases were definitely raided
25 Aug 2017 19:00:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Lol is idc if it was his brother or him, it happened with his acc so the acc gets banned
25 Aug 2017 19:00:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Pikadude1228#0109, Mben
25 Aug 2017 19:00:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, I'll come on
25 Aug 2017 19:01:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I think skullshoner was raided too but I can't find his base
25 Aug 2017 19:02:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Could be, aaron had his dislocator linked to mben his base
25 Aug 2017 19:03:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, There was stuff missing from mbens base
25 Aug 2017 19:03:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, And blocks with mbens name in Aaron's Me system
25 Aug 2017 19:04:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, so basically aaron went on a raiding spree
25 Aug 2017 19:04:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Yeah pretty much
25 Aug 2017 19:04:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, He took 38 drives from me and oder
25 Aug 2017 19:04:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Still looking for 18 but i think he destroyed them
25 Aug 2017 19:05:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, or their hidden somewhere else
25 Aug 2017 19:05:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Was also thinking about ghat yes
25 Aug 2017 19:05:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, I also can't figure out where the thaumic energistics stuff came from
25 Aug 2017 19:05:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, you tried teleporting to all his homes and seeing if their at any of them?
25 Aug 2017 19:06:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, He should only have 1 home though
25 Aug 2017 19:06:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, He's no donator
25 Aug 2017 19:06:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, oh
25 Aug 2017 19:06:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Who has the dislocater?
25 Aug 2017 19:06:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, what about his alt, maybe that has a home set?
25 Aug 2017 19:06:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, Nope
25 Aug 2017 19:07:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, I need to see where commander basti logged out
25 Aug 2017 19:07:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, he may have a chest hidden in the ground/walls where you cant find it
25 Aug 2017 19:07:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, But for that i need royals or maybe op
25 Aug 2017 19:08:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Thats an option yes, problem is they charge a base with lucaheller so i can't just go in and destroy all :p
25 Aug 2017 19:08:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, i have no idea what that is XD
25 Aug 2017 19:08:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, But maybe he might know something
25 Aug 2017 19:09:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, possibly
25 Aug 2017 19:09:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, We can ask Luke to identify what's his and destroy the rest
25 Aug 2017 19:09:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jd#0572, If Luke is an honest person

25 Aug 2017 19:13:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, Only thing I can suggest is use x-ray on his base to see if he's hidden them in the ground or something
