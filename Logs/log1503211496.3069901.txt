20 Aug 2017 11:25:41 : The Pack, bot-chat, tigertiger02#4338, What's going on here
20 Aug 2017 11:25:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, The world name can't
20 Aug 2017 11:25:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, the warp name can though
20 Aug 2017 11:25:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, ./spawn
20 Aug 2017 11:25:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, which is what people will see
20 Aug 2017 11:26:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, We don't actually need warps, it's all /is spawn and /spawn
20 Aug 2017 11:26:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Sorry, /is home I think actually
20 Aug 2017 11:26:24 : The Pack, bot-chat, tigertiger02#4338, Well Michael u might want to take some screen shots to show to molly about this
20 Aug 2017 11:26:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, ah I see I see

20 Aug 2017 11:26:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, No nether, right?
20 Aug 2017 11:26:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so on the actual spawn we need stuff that explains all this
20 Aug 2017 11:26:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I believe no nether
20 Aug 2017 11:26:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, End?
20 Aug 2017 11:26:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, we do need the end
20 Aug 2017 11:27:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, for killing the dragon and chaos guardian
20 Aug 2017 11:27:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, ah, there we go then
20 Aug 2017 11:27:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but I don't think we should have a warp for it
20 Aug 2017 11:27:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, How does that work?
20 Aug 2017 11:27:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, No naturally spawning end portals?
20 Aug 2017 11:27:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I think there is a mod in there that does it
20 Aug 2017 11:27:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I am not too sure though
20 Aug 2017 11:27:48 : The Pack, bot-chat, Kangaroo1212#7324, yes i agree
20 Aug 2017 11:28:30 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, They weren't when I did /spawn
20 Aug 2017 11:28:34 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, I fell into the void
20 Aug 2017 11:28:45 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, Plus the grass thingy ends up covered in mobs
20 Aug 2017 11:28:55 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, we need to work on the spawn place and the grass thingy

20 Aug 2017 19:12:35 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, You transfer your server files to the host..
20 Aug 2017 19:12:42 : PokeIslands, general, DaComputerNerd#0914, you can host one on your computer but it means it eats up a lot of memory at all times
20 Aug 2017 19:13:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, using a host is better then hosting it urself in any case
20 Aug 2017 19:13:06 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, Brady
20 Aug 2017 19:13:11 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, Can you edit to
20 Aug 2017 19:13:17 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, pixelmon uses 3gigs of ram

20 Aug 2017 19:13:28 : PokeIslands, staff, dragonbro0803#0985, Or however you spell it
20 Aug 2017 19:13:33 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so you have to see that your server has enough of ram left for the other miods/plugins you use
20 Aug 2017 19:13:44 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, then you need another bunch of ram for players to join
20 Aug 2017 19:13:49 : PokeIslands, general, DaComputerNerd#0914, i have 16, but its a laptop, so i couldnt have a server up all the time
20 Aug 2017 19:14:12 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, I have 8 gigs of wam
20 Aug 2017 19:14:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hosting a server on ur pc 24/7 is bad anyways

20 Aug 2017 19:14:30 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, coz you can smoke up your pc/laptop

22 Aug 2017 04:01:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, Baka what do u think should be done with the spawners that were set up to troll people?
22 Aug 2017 04:03:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, needs to be removed of course
22 Aug 2017 04:03:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, if jay is able to fix a server crash caused by a bad flower
22 Aug 2017 04:03:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, he should be able to fix this
22 Aug 2017 04:04:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, true
22 Aug 2017 04:04:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, but i think they shouldnt be removed but the mobs per chunk should be lowered to like 10

22 Aug 2017 04:33:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, venzi#0986, Yeah

22 Aug 2017 04:36:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, probably means whoever coded embers messed up a bit on class hierarchy
22 Aug 2017 04:36:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, creating a bug

22 Aug 2017 08:10:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Any staff can remove this if they think it breaks the rules. I want to make everone aware of this so they don't fall into the same trap I did. I joined a server called ShapeTheCube and was playing there for about a month. Donated over $100. After one stupid mistake all the players got shitty with me. I felt alienated and was ignored constantly. I then got a message from one of the higher staff dying day (in a screenshot below) decided to be hateful towards me. So I put my feelings straight. Then the owner got really nasty towards me as you can see in the picture below. So I urge everyone to stay clear of that server as quite frankly they are not nice owners and do not give a fuck about the players. Rant over. Staff remove this is you think it's breaking the rules at all. Many thanks.

22 Aug 2017 11:01:12 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Going to remove that because it's not really relevant to this, and while I love a bit of he-said she-said I don't like dirty laundry being aired in public
22 Aug 2017 11:01:27 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, @MisterChamp
22 Aug 2017 11:01:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Chances of anyone going on that server are basically 0 anyway, so take some comfort in that
22 Aug 2017 11:01:51 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, @Ozicarus
22 Aug 2017 11:02:01 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ok, so first of all
22 Aug 2017 11:02:10 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Learn2use wildcards
22 Aug 2017 11:02:20 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, You could've just done griefprevention.admin.*
22 Aug 2017 11:02:39 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, should we do this in staff chat?
22 Aug 2017 11:02:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, mkay 😛
22 Aug 2017 11:02:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Go on then
22 Aug 2017 11:03:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I see what you mean for that
22 Aug 2017 11:03:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, valid point
22 Aug 2017 11:03:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, would have been easier
22 Aug 2017 11:03:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, I just minimised all those to 3 nodes
22 Aug 2017 11:03:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Still got all the nucleus ones to do though, they're not so easy
22 Aug 2017 11:03:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, makes life much easier
22 Aug 2017 11:04:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, the issue is the people can't teleport to the "world" world
22 Aug 2017 11:04:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, which is what is what is really weird
22 Aug 2017 11:05:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, i'm looking in to that
22 Aug 2017 11:05:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, First things first though, people don't need all these GP commands because it's managed through the islands plugin
22 Aug 2017 11:05:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, If you give them subdivision etc. they're going to break it
22 Aug 2017 11:06:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well part of the issue we have is teams
22 Aug 2017 11:06:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, like you can't actually make teams on the islands
22 Aug 2017 11:06:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, like the /island invite command just isn't a thing
22 Aug 2017 11:06:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, ./trust
22 Aug 2017 11:06:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's just trust
22 Aug 2017 11:06:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, is that not just gp claims?
22 Aug 2017 11:06:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It is
22 Aug 2017 11:06:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So we need the trust node
22 Aug 2017 11:07:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, In fact, thinking about it - that's literally all they need
22 Aug 2017 11:07:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, untrust
22 Aug 2017 11:07:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Creation, deletion, expansion - that's all handled by the plugin
22 Aug 2017 11:07:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yeah okay
22 Aug 2017 11:08:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Have you got a list of the perms?
22 Aug 2017 11:10:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I can find them for the plugins but not to hand
22 Aug 2017 11:10:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Just for GP
22 Aug 2017 11:11:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Found them
22 Aug 2017 11:11:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, https://github.com/MinecraftPortCentral/GriefPrevention/wiki/Permissions
22 Aug 2017 11:11:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, ah okay
22 Aug 2017 11:14:11 : PokeIslands, news, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @​everyone i am looking into the problems with the server
22 Aug 2017 11:14:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, There, sorted
22 Aug 2017 11:14:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Market's a bit shit in that it's staff commands are market.command.staff.* - so we can't give users market.command.* else they'll also get all the staff stuff
22 Aug 2017 11:15:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Nucleus I think there's a few more nodes for
22 Aug 2017 11:15:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so people can now travel across to the "world" world?
22 Aug 2017 11:15:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, market is but it works
22 Aug 2017 11:15:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, No, i've not gotten around to that yet
22 Aug 2017 11:15:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, oh what is sorted then
22 Aug 2017 11:15:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I'm just getting the perms in order first, because this is a permission issue
22 Aug 2017 11:16:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, GP
22 Aug 2017 11:16:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, righttttt
22 Aug 2017 11:16:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I am dumb
22 Aug 2017 11:16:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, hmm Timed Out >_<
22 Aug 2017 11:16:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I see what you did now
22 Aug 2017 11:16:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So you've got to think, what plugins would possibly be fucking with this
22 Aug 2017 11:16:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, My mind first goes to skyclaims
22 Aug 2017 11:16:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well they have the perms to do the command I know that
22 Aug 2017 11:16:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Or the multiworld plugin
22 Aug 2017 11:16:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, as when they are in the world world the commands work
22 Aug 2017 11:16:54 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Does it just need a restart? (I would assume you tired that already)
22 Aug 2017 11:16:55 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, time to restart my pc i gues its weird i can acces all other websites like its nothing except that one
22 Aug 2017 11:17:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but when they are in the hub world the commands don't work
22 Aug 2017 11:17:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So they don't get TP'ed from the hub to the main world?
22 Aug 2017 11:17:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Wait
22 Aug 2017 11:17:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So none of the commands work in the hub?
22 Aug 2017 11:17:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, no they can /island create and can do stuff in the hub world
22 Aug 2017 11:17:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but stuff that would tp them from the hub world to the world world doesn't work
22 Aug 2017 11:18:02 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Only on to see what's up @༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻ ?
22 Aug 2017 11:18:06 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, XD
22 Aug 2017 11:18:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, like /tpa will go through but not tp them /home won't work
22 Aug 2017 11:18:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, like they can do the commands but it won't let them tp to the diffrent dimension
22 Aug 2017 11:20:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ahhh, that makes it more clear
22 Aug 2017 11:20:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So this seems like they don't have the permission to TP to a world
22 Aug 2017 11:20:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So can they TP back from the world to the hub?
22 Aug 2017 11:20:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I believe so yes
22 Aug 2017 11:20:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, https://gyazo.com/836bd75a46c6cce147871ff45fc0bf0f
22 Aug 2017 11:20:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Right...
22 Aug 2017 11:20:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Well, that's confusing
22 Aug 2017 11:21:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well it confused me to yeah 😛

22 Aug 2017 11:22:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, want me to test dummy some stuff?
22 Aug 2017 11:22:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, In a moment
22 Aug 2017 11:22:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, What's this skyclaim.default-schematic thing?
22 Aug 2017 11:22:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It doesn't appear in the perms list
22 Aug 2017 11:23:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I saw it in the nodes list, I assumed that meant it would load from the default schematic
22 Aug 2017 11:23:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but I don't think it makes much of a diffrence
22 Aug 2017 11:24:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Was going to say - I thought the default schematic was stated in the config file
22 Aug 2017 11:24:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well as did I but I saw a node for it so I put it in
22 Aug 2017 11:25:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, 
22 Aug 2017 11:25:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I'm just trying to think wtf this is broken for
22 Aug 2017 11:25:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, hahaha I am glad you are as confused as me
22 Aug 2017 11:26:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, That castle looks nice
22 Aug 2017 11:26:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yeah it is looking really good even with my shit picture taking skills
22 Aug 2017 11:26:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, not done yet but it is really good
22 Aug 2017 11:26:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, also people don't have the /spawn command now XD
22 Aug 2017 11:27:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, oh I think the inherit is just fucked up...
22 Aug 2017 11:27:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i can acces the normal page fine like  https://gyazo.com/95f0e4dfe543d175341464129fa080cc
22 Aug 2017 11:27:47 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its just the console i cant reach >_<
22 Aug 2017 11:27:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so on a new note it looks like the tracks don't actually inherit.......
22 Aug 2017 11:27:59 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, That's weird.

22 Aug 2017 11:36:00 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, This guide will guide you on how to upload and use your own JAR file, whether it be a developer build of Craftbukkit, Tekkit or any other JAR you'd like to use.


         Step 1. Download the Filezilla FTP client which can be found here: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php (You can also use any other FTP client of your choice).

         Step 2. Log into your Multicraft -> Click on 'Files' -> Click on 'FTP File Access'

         Step 3. Enter the the listed FTP information into a client of your choice. (We recommend Filezilla because it is free and easy to use.)

         Step 4. Connect to your server via FTP.

         Step 5. Create a folder in your server directory and name it 'jar'.

         Step 6. Upload the JAR file you wish to use to that folder.

         Step 7. Go back to your Multicraft control panel and type in the name of the jar you've just uploaded. (Make sure to type the name precisely. It must be typed exactly as it is named or it will not load properly.) For example, if you uploaded craftbukkit.jar, type in craftbukkit.jar where it says 'JAR File'.

         Step 8. Click save and restart your server.

22 Aug 2017 12:18:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, @Mike So it's recognising that you're ready to rank up but not actually triggering the commands
22 Aug 2017 12:18:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that is weird
22 Aug 2017 12:19:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, anyone of y knows quicky baby? well atleast those in the UK should know him xD
22 Aug 2017 12:19:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so I guess the question is why is it not triggering the commands and how do we make it trigger them

22 Aug 2017 12:42:00 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, A server on ggservers.
22 Aug 2017 12:42:05 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Maybe, maybe not.
22 Aug 2017 12:42:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i started with a 3gigs one 😉
22 Aug 2017 12:42:22 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, ik
22 Aug 2017 12:42:31 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I like 4. Less lag for everyone.
22 Aug 2017 12:42:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 3 also less lagg xD
22 Aug 2017 12:42:56 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Yeah but, 4 is even less. (Which is already like none at 3 but, eh.)
22 Aug 2017 12:42:58 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ask @striker7912  xD
22 Aug 2017 12:43:08 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Plus I may want other mods.
22 Aug 2017 12:43:12 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, he was like I love this :p
22 Aug 2017 12:43:27 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i am running 40+ mods since sponge plugins are mods
22 Aug 2017 12:43:43 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Well, "mods" isn't technically true.
22 Aug 2017 12:43:55 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, They don't take up as much RAM as big actual mods.
22 Aug 2017 12:44:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well spongeforge is just a mod which holds some sort of API
22 Aug 2017 12:44:53 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I still have no idea what to do about my other two servers. You saw my solution to this problem?
22 Aug 2017 12:44:56 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, http://www.strawpoll.me/13762212/
22 Aug 2017 12:45:43 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, euhm did you disable multiple votes?
22 Aug 2017 12:45:59 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I enabled it on purpose.
22 Aug 2017 12:46:05 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, You are supposed to choose two.
22 Aug 2017 12:46:19 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yeh but it seems like someone voted for 4
22 Aug 2017 12:46:24 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Nope.
22 Aug 2017 12:46:28 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, That's two people.
22 Aug 2017 12:47:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, you waiting for more votes or?
22 Aug 2017 12:47:16 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if not remove the 2 that have 0 votes
22 Aug 2017 12:47:16 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Ye
22 Aug 2017 12:47:25 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, WAitng for more..
22 Aug 2017 12:47:51 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, You know, you could vote too. *wink wink*
22 Aug 2017 12:47:52 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, XD
22 Aug 2017 12:47:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i would do it this way wait for more votes if a certain server type maches another servers vote
22 Aug 2017 12:48:11 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, remove 2 servers which have the lowest vote
22 Aug 2017 12:48:24 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and revote but only enable 1 vote each ip
22 Aug 2017 12:48:53 : PokeIslands, staff, Spuddy👌#3462, jeff ):
22 Aug 2017 12:48:54 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, meh this is so confusing lol
22 Aug 2017 12:49:03 : PokeIslands, staff, KiritoSanPlays#2208, My Name IS Jeff
22 Aug 2017 12:49:10 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, That disables multiple votes tho and I WANT people to choose two.
22 Aug 2017 12:49:10 : PokeIslands, staff, Spuddy👌#3462, xd
22 Aug 2017 12:49:36 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, That way there is double the amount of votes there a re people and whatever two win they get put on my servers.
22 Aug 2017 12:49:44 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its no use in having people vote for 2 servers if only like 4 server types are enabled lol
22 Aug 2017 12:50:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and i am not known in Hexxit and all these others lel
22 Aug 2017 12:50:35 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, There are six options.
22 Aug 2017 12:51:01 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, So, two votes each makes sense. Also, teh main point is that I ahve two servers. You vote for which two you want to be able to play.
22 Aug 2017 12:51:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yeh there are 6 server types but i mean what if 2 server types have the same ammount of vote?
22 Aug 2017 12:51:35 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Then the disput eis decided by whichever one would run better or would simply just work better.
22 Aug 2017 12:51:52 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I've used every single thing on there before. XD
22 Aug 2017 12:52:08 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Not nececarily on my server.
22 Aug 2017 12:52:09 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i am only known with pixelmon and regular survival
22 Aug 2017 12:52:30 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Well, maybe you could have some fun trying one (or two XD) of those.
22 Aug 2017 12:53:02 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i've hosted alot of pixelmon and survival-pvp

22 Aug 2017 18:16:32 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Gyrkkus#9461, Read it to old comp, copy to flash drive
22 Aug 2017 18:20:09 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, if the actual case doesnt have room for a disk drive, just keep the side of your case open, attatch a disk drive and then once finished remove it
22 Aug 2017 18:20:16 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, thats what ive gotta do with my new build
22 Aug 2017 18:20:22 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, gaming pc cases dont have room for disk drives
22 Aug 2017 18:23:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Or... take the sensible option!
22 Aug 2017 18:24:06 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Most copies of windows come on a USB stick these days - but you can make your very own in the comfort of your home

22 Aug 2017 18:24:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Go there, create installation media - you can use any memory stick you have lying around as long as it's about 4GB
22 Aug 2017 18:24:57 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, @Bl0k
22 Aug 2017 18:25:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, @MisterChamp
22 Aug 2017 18:25:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, If you're talking about the NZXT or micro-ATX /HTPC cases, sure
22 Aug 2017 18:25:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, thats ma name 😛
22 Aug 2017 18:26:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, But most cases have plenty of front 3.5" bays, they're far from outdated
22 Aug 2017 18:26:06 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, meh, i already bought the disk, and i have a spare disk drive in m drawerr
22 Aug 2017 18:26:24 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Do you not have a USB stick?
22 Aug 2017 18:26:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i do, but not one thats got enough memory lol
22 Aug 2017 18:26:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Ah, I keep a bunch of them around for this sort of stuff
22 Aug 2017 18:26:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So convenient
22 Aug 2017 18:28:06 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, ive got the CiT F3 White Matx Gaming Case
22 Aug 2017 18:28:49 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Aaah, yeah - Micro ATX cuts all that stuff out
22 Aug 2017 18:29:08 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, yup lol
22 Aug 2017 18:29:22 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Meanwhile, I have https://www.scan.co.uk/products/nzxt-source-340-black-with-blue-trim-mid-tower-case-with-usb3-side-window-2x120mm-quiet-fans-w-o-psu
22 Aug 2017 18:29:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Where there is actually space for 3.5" bays, they just decided not to put them in for some reason
22 Aug 2017 18:29:37 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Airflow I guess

22 Aug 2017 18:30:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, mines a custom build, and i dont really see a need for disk drives
22 Aug 2017 18:30:58 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Lol, who's isn't these days?
22 Aug 2017 18:31:13 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It's so easy to get in to building computers, i've helped a few people do it
22 Aug 2017 18:31:20 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, sane
22 Aug 2017 18:31:23 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, same*
22 Aug 2017 18:31:27 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, The thing is, they can do it - they're just worried about breaking something
22 Aug 2017 18:31:30 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, btw that case looks pretty good 😛
22 Aug 2017 18:31:45 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, its very hard to break something when building a pc
22 Aug 2017 18:31:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Ikr?
22 Aug 2017 18:31:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, if its hard to put the connectors on then stop
22 Aug 2017 18:32:18 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Like they'll put the graphics card in - they'll leave it half hanging out of the slot
22 Aug 2017 18:32:23 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, RAM IT IN THERE!
22 Aug 2017 18:32:33 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, lol
22 Aug 2017 18:32:35 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It's very hard to break the stuff
22 Aug 2017 18:32:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, exactly
22 Aug 2017 18:33:00 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, they aint as fragile as people make them out to be
22 Aug 2017 18:33:14 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, What else are you putting in this build, then?
22 Aug 2017 18:33:54 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, its pretty much finished, just waiting till payday to get the ram cards
22 Aug 2017 18:34:10 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Gimme specs
22 Aug 2017 18:34:11 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, got an i7 cpu, 850w psu, a GT1080
22 Aug 2017 18:34:25 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, 2tb hdd space
22 Aug 2017 18:34:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, What mobo?
22 Aug 2017 18:34:56 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, errr gimme one sec to dig out the box XD cant even remember now
22 Aug 2017 18:35:47 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i remember now, the MSI tomahawk arctic
22 Aug 2017 18:36:13 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i remember cos i was getting it mixed up with the mortar arctic
22 Aug 2017 18:36:29 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, What brand PSU, out of curiosity?
22 Aug 2017 18:36:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, intel 😛
22 Aug 2017 18:36:43 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, ... Intel makes psus?
22 Aug 2017 18:36:49 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, oh psu
22 Aug 2017 18:37:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, sorry tired thought you said cpu XD
22 Aug 2017 18:37:28 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, SilverRose13#0794, lol
22 Aug 2017 18:38:08 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, And you're aware the tomahawk arctic is an ATX form factor, while the case only supports mATX?
22 Aug 2017 18:38:09 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i can unfortuanately say i dont have a clue... it doesnt have a company name on the box lol
22 Aug 2017 18:38:14 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Oh god.
22 Aug 2017 18:38:24 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, yh, i probs shoulda looked at that....
22 Aug 2017 18:38:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i think ima change it out now XD
22 Aug 2017 18:38:41 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, concidering the think was only £30......
22 Aug 2017 18:38:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So you've got a case which isn't big enough... and a power supply with an unknown manufacturer
22 Aug 2017 18:39:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, For a motherboard which costs over $100, a graphics card over $500, and a processor over $300

22 Aug 2017 18:39:16 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, wait the case wont be big enough o_o
22 Aug 2017 18:39:49 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, It'd be fine if you got an mATX board - it's long enough to support a 310mm graphics card, with most 1080s coming in around 260mm

22 Aug 2017 18:41:09 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah - but more importantly, the power supply
22 Aug 2017 18:41:14 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Have you already bought the power supply?
22 Aug 2017 18:41:26 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, yeah, and its safe to say im not using it in the pc XD
22 Aug 2017 18:41:34 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Thank fuck for that
22 Aug 2017 18:41:36 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, i didnt even order it, i got my uncle to get it
22 Aug 2017 18:42:44 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, You want a 600w or so for an i7/1080 for the sake of future upgrades or whatever, and for the connectors - as most of the 1080s need two connections
22 Aug 2017 18:42:52 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, FROM A KNOWN BRAND
22 Aug 2017 18:43:03 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Not Hong Kong Power Industries
22 Aug 2017 18:43:06 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, ComputahSaysNo#3209, modular is nice too when you're building
22 Aug 2017 18:43:11 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, ^^

22 Aug 2017 18:43:39 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, ComputahSaysNo#3209, Well
22 Aug 2017 18:43:58 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, ComputahSaysNo#3209, I've heard the CX series isn't great either
22 Aug 2017 18:44:17 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, though they seem to have improved in the last year or so
22 Aug 2017 18:44:32 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, You need to make sure you get one with the new style label on the CX series
