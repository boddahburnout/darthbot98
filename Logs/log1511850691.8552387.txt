28 Nov 2017 06:39:01 : FAM, off-topic, darth kota#9446, @WafflesTheWaffle fix his perms -_-
28 Nov 2017 14:46:20 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, @Darth Kota98 my bad lol. i fixed it.
28 Nov 2017 14:49:09 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, @Darth Kota98 well, there is three music bots because one plays radio, and then the other two glitch out sometimes. same with darthbot, it also gets buggy sometimes. it is just nice to have backup bots until they get reset. and gamestats, mathbot, and dankmemer do other things. mr meeseeks manages the server too. I can remove mathbot and gamestats since no one really uses them.

28 Nov 2017 14:50:40 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, @Darth Kota98 i guess it isa also nice to have the two music bots since you cant have 1 in two channels at the same time
28 Nov 2017 14:55:01 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, @Darth Kota98 can you make your bot do polls?
28 Nov 2017 14:55:51 : FAM, main, Mee6#4876, @Simple Poll, Welcome to **FAM** ! <:PCMR:382251419685617674>
28 Nov 2017 14:57:23 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, if you can make it do polls, play spotify/pandora/radio stations that would be amazing. i think the radio one  would be pretty hard though.

28 Nov 2017 18:55:04 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, how do you run multiple darth bots?
28 Nov 2017 18:55:13 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, @Darth Kota98
28 Nov 2017 18:55:43 : FAM, off-topic, darth kota#9446, just run a nother copy of him with a different token
28 Nov 2017 18:57:57 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, wat
28 Nov 2017 18:58:10 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, like, it would show two darth bots online right?
28 Nov 2017 18:59:54 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, but wouldnt they both need different command prefixes? like right now it is a semi colon, so if you had two it would need to be something different, correct?
28 Nov 2017 19:00:32 : FAM, off-topic, WafflesTheWaffle#4121, try and see if you can copy astolfo's radio codes. i am not sure where it is sourcing from, but it works really well
