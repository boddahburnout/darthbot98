01 Apr 2017 22:20:03 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Well, hopefully in a few minutes, you would see this instead
01 Apr 2017 22:20:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, anyone here that can help me
01 Apr 2017 22:20:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, with?
01 Apr 2017 22:20:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, im trying to figure out how to increase my claim without having to always make a box
01 Apr 2017 22:20:31 : LimitlessMc, botchat, How am i?#5495, Ooo, okey i will again afterwords then
01 Apr 2017 22:20:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, has to be a box
01 Apr 2017 22:20:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, XD
01 Apr 2017 22:20:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but you could try making several different claims
01 Apr 2017 22:21:05 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, instead of 1 big one
01 Apr 2017 22:21:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, then how did this one guy have 2 claims in 2 different locations?
01 Apr 2017 22:21:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, you can seperate your claim chunks into seperate boxes, but all of them have to be boxes
01 Apr 2017 22:21:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, if you cant increase your claim because it must be a box at all times then he shouldnt beable to seperate it
01 Apr 2017 22:22:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, he has 2 boxes
01 Apr 2017 22:22:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, thats what you told me
01 Apr 2017 22:22:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, you said it must be a box
01 Apr 2017 22:22:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, no, i said it has to be a box
01 Apr 2017 22:22:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, yea
01 Apr 2017 22:22:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, didnt say you coudlnt have 2
01 Apr 2017 22:22:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, but you can only have 1 box
01 Apr 2017 22:22:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, no
01 Apr 2017 22:22:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, then you do not understand what i am asking
01 Apr 2017 22:22:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, then ask again
01 Apr 2017 22:22:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and maybe I'll get it
01 Apr 2017 22:23:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, @Vinyl Scratch  one chunk is 16Ã—16, right? You have 5 chunka in the beginning i think, then you can claim chunks at different places
01 Apr 2017 22:24:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, One chunk will always be a box
01 Apr 2017 22:24:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, im asking how do you claim chunks without having them to be a giant box
01 Apr 2017 22:24:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, my claim is 3x5
01 Apr 2017 22:24:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, i cannot seperate it
01 Apr 2017 22:24:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, Use a stick on the claim
01 Apr 2017 22:24:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, And you will se your land
01 Apr 2017 22:24:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, if i try to seperate it it deleted my claim
01 Apr 2017 22:25:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, Not all tho, only the chunk you are standing om
01 Apr 2017 22:25:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you can't "seperate" a claim once its been made, you can re-size it tho
01 Apr 2017 22:25:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but you can claim a 2nd claim somewhere else
01 Apr 2017 22:25:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, yea every time i resize it it destroys what i want
01 Apr 2017 22:25:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, still not understanding ive told third this
01 Apr 2017 22:25:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, no one understands me

01 Apr 2017 22:29:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, yes

01 Apr 2017 22:29:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, question 1, why
01 Apr 2017 22:29:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, y not
01 Apr 2017 22:30:00 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, no, not you justin

01 Apr 2017 22:30:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, @JustinOPGamer  can you ride the megas now?
01 Apr 2017 22:30:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, gym and my room
01 Apr 2017 22:30:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, @How am i?  nope
01 Apr 2017 22:30:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, i can
01 Apr 2017 22:30:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, How
01 Apr 2017 22:30:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, but u cant normally
01 Apr 2017 22:30:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you have to claim in 16x16 chunks, you cant claim individual blocks
01 Apr 2017 22:30:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, /ride command
01 Apr 2017 22:30:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, JustinOPGamer#9138, ^^^
01 Apr 2017 22:31:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, i dont have enough chunks to buy a 16x16
01 Apr 2017 22:31:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so I'm assuming you want to claim the chunks your room is in?
01 Apr 2017 22:31:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, each chunk isss 16x16
01 Apr 2017 22:31:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, i have a 3x5
01 Apr 2017 22:31:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, which is 15 chunks
01 Apr 2017 22:31:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, @Vinyl Scratch  btw which gym you doing?
01 Apr 2017 22:31:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, what happens when you do /buychunks whats the number you get?
01 Apr 2017 22:31:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, 15 out of 16
01 Apr 2017 22:32:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, because 16 is default
01 Apr 2017 22:32:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so you can claim 15 16x16 areas
01 Apr 2017 22:32:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, my claim is 3x5 not 16x16
01 Apr 2017 22:32:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it doesnt matter how small your claim is, you can ONLY claim in 16x16 areas
01 Apr 2017 22:32:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, My brian hurts
01 Apr 2017 22:33:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so if you claim that 3x5 you claim the whole 16x16 it is in
01 Apr 2017 22:33:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, How am i?#5495, Alot
01 Apr 2017 22:33:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, im trying to get my storage room claimed but i cannot do it everytime i do it it gets rid of my other claim
01 Apr 2017 22:33:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, never mind
01 Apr 2017 22:33:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, ill wait till third gets on
01 Apr 2017 22:33:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, I'll be IG shortly, and I can explan better
01 Apr 2017 22:34:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Vinyl Scratch#2518, first off wert you are off topic to what im talking about
