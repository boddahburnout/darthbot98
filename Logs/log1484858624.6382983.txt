19 Jan 2017 20:46:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, yes wert kill us
19 Jan 2017 20:46:13 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, You pick a pokemon, and you are stuck with it
19 Jan 2017 20:46:18 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Oh
19 Jan 2017 20:46:22 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, unless you want to reset your Levels, and XP
19 Jan 2017 20:46:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Oops
19 Jan 2017 20:46:27 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, its local bot rn
19 Jan 2017 20:46:42 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, wert doesnt want to kill we tho
19 Jan 2017 20:46:48 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Sooo, what else is planned?
19 Jan 2017 20:46:58 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, STAB extra damage based off of type
19 Jan 2017 20:47:20 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1.1x per type per use in a combo, for a double type pokemon
19 Jan 2017 20:47:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Only one type, I'm guessing
19 Jan 2017 20:47:28 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1.2x for a mono-type
19 Jan 2017 20:47:28 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Oh
19 Jan 2017 20:48:07 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Because there's some pokemon games that force monotype
19 Jan 2017 20:48:16 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Could be easier
19 Jan 2017 20:48:29 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, nah, doenst make a difference in my end
19 Jan 2017 20:48:44 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, only this is balance
19 Jan 2017 20:48:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, XD
19 Jan 2017 20:48:57 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause having 1.1 and 1.2 would make double types do more damage
19 Jan 2017 20:48:59 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Ofc, Gallade being Psychic/Fighting doesn't help with your bot
19 Jan 2017 20:49:03 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, xD
19 Jan 2017 20:49:04 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, rip
19 Jan 2017 20:49:19 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I might need to add the other types
19 Jan 2017 20:49:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I'll see
19 Jan 2017 20:49:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, asap wert asap
19 Jan 2017 20:49:32 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, that person said
19 Jan 2017 20:49:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, as soon as possible
19 Jan 2017 20:49:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Or manually retype based on letters
19 Jan 2017 20:49:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, get with the wants of some random
19 Jan 2017 20:49:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, quick!
19 Jan 2017 20:50:09 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Like Fire, Fighting, and Fairy could all be F type
19 Jan 2017 20:50:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, xD its not some random
19 Jan 2017 20:50:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its my roomate
19 Jan 2017 20:50:28 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Grass and Ground could be G type
19 Jan 2017 20:50:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, to me is a random
19 Jan 2017 20:50:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and his username is the girl from shelter in Jap
19 Jan 2017 20:50:53 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, I could
19 Jan 2017 20:50:55 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, But that still makes for inconsistencies
19 Jan 2017 20:51:10 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, that shouldnt be too hard
19 Jan 2017 20:51:20 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Because if somebody is a Torterra
19 Jan 2017 20:51:32 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Are they monotype or dual?
19 Jan 2017 20:51:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ChesireKat#7022, nice lel
19 Jan 2017 20:51:57 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, It would count as duel, but most likely it will only give 1.1x per G
19 Jan 2017 20:52:09 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, based off the way I am considering coding it
19 Jan 2017 20:52:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, actually, I could have it give 1.1x to each G twice
19 Jan 2017 20:52:36 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ill have to see
19 Jan 2017 20:52:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ;level
19 Jan 2017 20:52:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, **Name**: *Wertfuzzy77*

19 Jan 2017 20:52:53 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, hmm, should I have it display a picture of your pokemon in ;level ?
19 Jan 2017 20:53:03 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, 1.1 times 1.1 is 1.2
19 Jan 2017 20:53:07 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, So
19 Jan 2017 20:53:10 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its 1.21
19 Jan 2017 20:53:19 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Yrah
19 Jan 2017 20:53:26 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, which means, on average, double types will do slighty more damage than single ones
19 Jan 2017 20:53:31 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Typing is werd atm
19 Jan 2017 20:54:16 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, But dual types with the same letter for their types could do slightly more
19 Jan 2017 20:54:39 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Aka Ghost/Grass
19 Jan 2017 20:54:48 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
19 Jan 2017 20:54:52 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Actually...

19 Jan 2017 20:55:14 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, So you have ten types atm
19 Jan 2017 20:55:26 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, i made it that way, seemed like a nice number
19 Jan 2017 20:55:39 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, And there's what, 17 Pokemon types?
19 Jan 2017 20:55:48 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 18
19 Jan 2017 20:56:35 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, So you could just attempt to double over the current onrs
19 Jan 2017 20:57:04 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ?
19 Jan 2017 20:57:22 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, 2 types per letter instead of just one
19 Jan 2017 20:57:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, But with two of the letters only having one
19 Jan 2017 20:58:41 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Because otherwise G covers three types by itself, and half of the other ones are stuck with one
19 Jan 2017 20:58:50 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, but combos are already getting long, now would be 2x as long

19 Jan 2017 20:59:03 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and wouldnt be able to show the moves in Emojis
19 Jan 2017 20:59:05 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, F also gets three types by itself
19 Jan 2017 20:59:17 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like, double letters dont exist like that
19 Jan 2017 21:00:18 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, I mean, E could cover Electric and, I don't know, FairE?
19 Jan 2017 21:00:28 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, As a poor example
19 Jan 2017 21:00:42 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Actually, F would be 4 types
19 Jan 2017 21:00:49 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, too many fs
19 Jan 2017 21:01:07 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Basically, trying to say
19 Jan 2017 21:01:23 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Spread the types over the letters
19 Jan 2017 21:01:40 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, 9 letters would be easier to do the math with
19 Jan 2017 21:03:05 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 
19 Jan 2017 21:03:05 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, B could be Bug and grass because of Botany, so a Torterra would be a B/G type in your system
19 Jan 2017 21:03:33 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, If G wasn't already Grass, that is
19 Jan 2017 21:03:37 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
19 Jan 2017 21:03:51 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Poison - Psychic

19 Jan 2017 21:04:19 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Yeah
19 Jan 2017 21:04:30 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Steel-Rock
19 Jan 2017 21:04:34 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Dragon - Dark
19 Jan 2017 21:05:00 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Normal - Flying
19 Jan 2017 21:05:08 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Rip Pidgot
19 Jan 2017 21:05:14 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, actually, ghost normal
19 Jan 2017 21:05:36 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Fairy-Dragon
19 Jan 2017 21:05:40 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Fighting - Fairy
19 Jan 2017 21:05:42 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, I like that better
19 Jan 2017 21:06:18 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, easier to keep the letters together even if they dont fit perfectly, keeps it simplier for everyone
19 Jan 2017 21:06:26 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, True
19 Jan 2017 21:06:35 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Fire?
19 Jan 2017 21:06:55 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Fire - Flying
19 Jan 2017 21:07:04 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but that gives us 2 F groups
19 Jan 2017 21:07:11 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Ye
19 Jan 2017 21:07:46 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Why don't we put Flying with Electric
19 Jan 2017 21:08:01 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Because storms
19 Jan 2017 21:08:31 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Maybe I should make names for all the 18 Types that don't share the same letter
19 Jan 2017 21:08:37 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Lol
19 Jan 2017 21:08:45 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like, rename the types xD
19 Jan 2017 21:09:16 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Well, look at the Romaji names for the types, then
19 Jan 2017 21:09:24 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Should give you an idea
19 Jan 2017 21:09:36 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Fairy can be renamed Magic btw
19 Jan 2017 21:09:40 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya,
19 Jan 2017 21:10:19 : LimitlessMc, botchat, TherminatorX#6644, Since that was the intended meaning
