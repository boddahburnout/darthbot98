16 Jul 2017 23:14:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, justingachoya#9734, oh
16 Jul 2017 23:14:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, but they didnt have to do anything stupid like shutdown pixelmon
16 Jul 2017 23:14:58 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, nintendo takes a big L for that one
16 Jul 2017 23:15:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, justingachoya#9734, lol truee
16 Jul 2017 23:15:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, stupidest decision ever made by nintendo
16 Jul 2017 23:15:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, We should run optifine on the server, best minecraft mod
16 Jul 2017 23:15:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, @justingachoya those channels are for music, if you wanna talk go to General

16 Jul 2017 23:15:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, justingachoya#9734, ight which general
16 Jul 2017 23:16:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, either
16 Jul 2017 23:16:12 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, It's their ip, and they probably felt that pixelmon was getting too similar to pokemon.
16 Jul 2017 23:16:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, soo whatnow
16 Jul 2017 23:16:49 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, so they shut it down, it sucks but that's the way it is
16 Jul 2017 23:16:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, What they should have done was bought out pixelmon and monotised it
16 Jul 2017 23:17:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, nekupe true but it didnt have to be like this
16 Jul 2017 23:17:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, can't
16 Jul 2017 23:17:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, They were scared of competition thats it
16 Jul 2017 23:17:17 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Microsoft wouldnt let them
16 Jul 2017 23:17:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, I mean they could if they struck a deal with Microsoft
16 Jul 2017 23:17:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, They love doing shit like that
16 Jul 2017 23:17:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, which isnt worth the $
16 Jul 2017 23:18:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, easier for them to just shut it down and move on
16 Jul 2017 23:18:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, Compatition? You do realize that Nintendo have much bigger compatition then these people, right?
16 Jul 2017 23:18:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, It really could be if they were smart with it
16 Jul 2017 23:18:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, they can't even really make money off of pixelmon
16 Jul 2017 23:18:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, considering the MC EULA
16 Jul 2017 23:18:35 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, Yeah but I don't see nintendo shutting down all the other competition
16 Jul 2017 23:18:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, instead they pull a dumb move to shutdown something not as popular
16 Jul 2017 23:18:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, Because Compation is good for buisness
16 Jul 2017 23:18:57 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Atlas#1413, Whats next?
16 Jul 2017 23:19:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Oh btw hi @ShadowJackyl
16 Jul 2017 23:19:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Atlas#1413, insurgence getting a friendly c&d?
16 Jul 2017 23:19:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, It better not be
16 Jul 2017 23:19:37 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, They only shut pixelmon down is because they were useing there IP, and getting to similar to it.
16 Jul 2017 23:20:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Like Pokemon insurgence, which needs to be released before it gets shot outta the water

16 Jul 2017 23:20:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I mean it does

16 Jul 2017 23:21:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, nekupe you can respect your opinion and i can respect mine
16 Jul 2017 23:21:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, you do know that pokemon is over 20 years old right? and pixelmon is only 5
16 Jul 2017 23:21:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, but still nintendo is garbage af
16 Jul 2017 23:21:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, That's fine, if it gets in the water, I'll have it downloaded well in advance
16 Jul 2017 23:21:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I mean xD its not an opinoin, they have a legal right to
16 Jul 2017 23:21:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, whether or not they should have tho
16 Jul 2017 23:21:45 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, thats a diff thing
16 Jul 2017 23:22:10 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, So @Wertfuzzy77 does this mean the end of team cipher?
16 Jul 2017 23:22:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, pixelmon was the one minecraft mod that had pokemon that actually had good updated
16 Jul 2017 23:22:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Cipher will live on in the next server
16 Jul 2017 23:22:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, and they had to shut it down
16 Jul 2017 23:22:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, pixelmon memorial monument at spawn

16 Jul 2017 23:24:13 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, nekupe how long is ur msg
16 Jul 2017 23:24:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, They didn't have to shut it down, but they did, because they felt that pixelmon was infringing on their copyright.
16 Jul 2017 23:24:16 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, just spit it out
16 Jul 2017 23:24:18 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Groudon flamethrowers can't melt steal beams, illuminati confirmed

16 Jul 2017 23:24:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, its a block game with pokemon aspects
16 Jul 2017 23:24:41 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, how is that copying
16 Jul 2017 23:24:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, cuz pokemon
16 Jul 2017 23:24:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, has pokemon
16 Jul 2017 23:24:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, pokemon and moves match in name
16 Jul 2017 23:24:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, derp
16 Jul 2017 23:24:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, and mechanics
16 Jul 2017 23:24:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, still bs
16 Jul 2017 23:25:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, I gave magma back to lunar, and it immediately fell apart
16 Jul 2017 23:25:11 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, With rounded models, battle rule/tiers, and mega evolution
16 Jul 2017 23:25:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Was horrible
16 Jul 2017 23:25:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, if you did that on a mobile app *and* got famous enough
16 Jul 2017 23:25:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, not really lel they took something not theirs and used it thus copywrite
16 Jul 2017 23:25:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, and last time i checked has more downloads than pokemon
16 Jul 2017 23:25:23 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, and im not even counting cracked users
16 Jul 2017 23:25:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, minecraft*
16 Jul 2017 23:25:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, Which is why they shut it down
16 Jul 2017 23:25:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, would probably get shot down by TPS as well
16 Jul 2017 23:26:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, making models from scratch was a flimsy justification at best
16 Jul 2017 23:26:26 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, I don't see any point in crying over spilled milk, pixelmon is dead, the pixelmon devs all were alright with it, and knew this day would come
16 Jul 2017 23:26:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Be glad it lasted this long
16 Jul 2017 23:26:38 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, ^
16 Jul 2017 23:26:54 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, ik ik but it shouldve never ended this way
16 Jul 2017 23:26:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, 5 years, that's a good run for a fab game
16 Jul 2017 23:27:03 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Fan*
16 Jul 2017 23:27:04 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, It always ends this way
16 Jul 2017 23:27:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, its how it was always going to end
16 Jul 2017 23:27:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Name a fan game as big as pixelmon that still gets updated and is still around
16 Jul 2017 23:27:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, ^
16 Jul 2017 23:27:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, crazycraft?
16 Jul 2017 23:27:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, The hell even is that?
16 Jul 2017 23:27:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Bakafish#8693, pokemon fangame*
16 Jul 2017 23:28:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, I mean, I've never heard of crazy craft, so I doubt it's as big as pixelmon was
16 Jul 2017 23:28:22 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, actually
16 Jul 2017 23:28:34 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, crazycraft was all the hype in 2014-2015-16 ish
16 Jul 2017 23:28:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, never even heard of it
16 Jul 2017 23:28:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, does it use copyright material ?
16 Jul 2017 23:28:47 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, Same
16 Jul 2017 23:28:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, I mean I lived through all of those years dude, never heard of it
16 Jul 2017 23:28:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, no
16 Jul 2017 23:28:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, xZyro#3967, its completely 100% original
16 Jul 2017 23:28:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, ruleroftri#6648, Dude, that's the point
16 Jul 2017 23:28:59 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, thats why its not shut down kek
16 Jul 2017 23:29:01 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, StubbyMuffins#1053, LOL
