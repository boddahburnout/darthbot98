16 Aug 2017 21:59:53 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, is my question

16 Aug 2017 22:01:50 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, you know setting max level to that breaks the game due the 0 limits
16 Aug 2017 22:02:11 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, even placing that as build height limit can get your game crashing
16 Aug 2017 22:02:29 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if i am correct you can set max level to 200 tough

16 Aug 2017 22:13:50 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, anyways since we updated mods ima try something in sp
16 Aug 2017 22:14:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, coz for some reason not only the login attempts make the server go nutz but also the swap from dark to born
16 Aug 2017 22:15:07 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, try going to dark
16 Aug 2017 22:15:12 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, start the server

16 Aug 2017 22:15:29 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, and then delete anything that may be corrupting
16 Aug 2017 22:15:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Saba#2249, turret mode dilos?
16 Aug 2017 22:15:41 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ðŸ˜‰ adding the world to SP logging in whitout mods sometimes fixes it
16 Aug 2017 22:16:03 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, alltough players might be getting missing items
16 Aug 2017 22:16:45 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ok it may look like a fresh start alltough everything is staying teh same as it was
16 Aug 2017 22:17:38 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, wait what
16 Aug 2017 22:18:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so adding a modded world to single player and logging in whitout mods removes al mobs and items from that mod
16 Aug 2017 22:18:28 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, which means all items that are from pixelmon dark and all mobs from pixelmon dark are removed from the world
16 Aug 2017 22:18:28 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Well we can always help rebuild striker's place
16 Aug 2017 22:18:35 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, everyone else didnt realyl have anything
