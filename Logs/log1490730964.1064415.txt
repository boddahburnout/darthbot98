29 Mar 2017 16:02:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, Well, before we do anything, what are you using to load pixelmon? What launcher and such
29 Mar 2017 16:02:39 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, the reg mc launcher
29 Mar 2017 16:02:52 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, Your using the recource pack?
29 Mar 2017 16:03:02 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, I am not using a resource pack
29 Mar 2017 16:03:25 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, Okay, so you have it in a mods folder in your mc launcher

29 Mar 2017 16:04:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, it isn't launching what it says is the minecraft launcher has stopped working
29 Mar 2017 16:05:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, then it gives meh the option to close the program
29 Mar 2017 16:05:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, which is the only option
29 Mar 2017 16:05:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, & idk how to screenshot it

29 Mar 2017 16:16:19 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, @Spider Bob Playz Use every recource you got is all i can say lol
29 Mar 2017 16:16:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Spider Bob Playz#7296, I will have to wait like 7 hours for him to get online though
29 Mar 2017 16:17:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Third_Worm#4804, Then continue finding/using the recources you have now then

29 Mar 2017 17:59:48 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, the point of the game is to try to figure out this code by taking educated guesses
29 Mar 2017 18:00:12 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Wertfuzzy77#0274, In this case, I would try to keep those 2 guesses that are correct, and change the other ones in hopes of finding another correct one

30 Mar 2017 02:34:21 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, AlphaBit#3869, Le
30 Mar 2017 02:34:27 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, AlphaBit#3869, Week*
30 Mar 2017 02:34:30 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Crystal4209#4698, lol
30 Mar 2017 02:34:31 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you can get a new battery, but how old it your laptop?
30 Mar 2017 02:34:51 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, around 4
30 Mar 2017 02:35:04 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, thats not terribly old
30 Mar 2017 02:35:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, AlphaBit#3869, @Third_Worm peewee
30 Mar 2017 02:35:25 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, any chance you can tell me some of the stats on it? like what CPU it has, or how much mem you have?
30 Mar 2017 02:35:38 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, uhhhh
30 Mar 2017 02:37:22 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, perfect 😄 thanks
30 Mar 2017 02:37:27 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:38:03 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, hmm, whats an intel iris? I didnt know intel made non-cpu graphics cards
30 Mar 2017 02:38:04 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, to google xD
30 Mar 2017 02:38:14 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:39:24 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, your cpu is fune, not that much less powerful than mine
30 Mar 2017 02:39:27 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, fine*
30 Mar 2017 02:39:34 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 8 GBs of Mem is all you need
30 Mar 2017 02:40:18 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and it looks like its an intergrated graphics chip with your CPU, so your graphics arent super powerful, but most laptops don't have graphics cards anyways
30 Mar 2017 02:40:24 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so yours is pretty good
30 Mar 2017 02:40:52 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, lol and a retina screen...i forgot what it does
30 Mar 2017 02:41:18 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, whats the resolution of the screen?
30 Mar 2017 02:41:26 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, idk
30 Mar 2017 02:41:29 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:41:40 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its prob like 720, or maybe even 1080
30 Mar 2017 02:41:52 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its 2013, so its not really too old yet
30 Mar 2017 02:42:01 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you don't really neeed to new one
30 Mar 2017 02:42:24 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, although mine was about the same age, but not as powerful as yours
30 Mar 2017 02:42:50 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, the one I have rn is just a monster of a Laptop xD there is no need for all the power this one has
30 Mar 2017 02:42:53 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but its cool 😛
30 Mar 2017 02:43:17 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, if the battery on yours is looking bad, I would just look into that for now
30 Mar 2017 02:43:41 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, ya
30 Mar 2017 02:43:53 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, i dont have a virus protection...lol
30 Mar 2017 02:44:30 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:44:34 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, gj

30 Mar 2017 02:44:53 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but still xD
30 Mar 2017 02:44:56 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, get something
30 Mar 2017 02:45:03 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, i have a free one rn
30 Mar 2017 02:45:06 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, its scanning
30 Mar 2017 02:45:40 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner-mac
30 Mar 2017 02:45:43 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, try this
30 Mar 2017 02:45:59 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, just run a scan of that and clear all the junk files on your computer
30 Mar 2017 02:46:24 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, will clear up some space on your computers, and speed it up a little
30 Mar 2017 02:46:40 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, maybe later 😛
30 Mar 2017 02:47:05 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya whenever you want to 😛 its just a little thing I use to clean up my pc
30 Mar 2017 02:47:12 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, also fixes registry stuff
30 Mar 2017 02:47:23 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, which is good an easy trick to speed up a slow PC
30 Mar 2017 02:48:01 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, my mac works fine just the battery sucks
30 Mar 2017 02:48:29 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you think it does xD and then you clean it up, and then boom, faster than you thought
30 Mar 2017 02:48:51 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:49:28 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and I only have a 256 GB harddrive xD so I need the space
30 Mar 2017 02:49:38 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, programming stuff and games take alotttt
30 Mar 2017 02:49:55 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ayy, it says I'm gonna save 2 GBs xD go me
30 Mar 2017 02:50:02 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, ....i have 8
30 Mar 2017 02:50:12 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, thats mem cutie 😛
30 Mar 2017 02:50:22 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, oh
30 Mar 2017 02:50:24 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, um
30 Mar 2017 02:50:27 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, what that
30 Mar 2017 02:50:38 : LimitlessMc, voice-junk, JustinOPGamer#9138, no @Crystal4209
30 Mar 2017 02:50:53 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, easy terms, Harddrive stores things permently, Mem stores things you are currently using
30 Mar 2017 02:51:08 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so you can be accessing and using 8 GBs of stuff at a time
30 Mar 2017 02:51:15 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but you can store a lot more
30 Mar 2017 02:51:20 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, ah
30 Mar 2017 02:51:22 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, i see
30 Mar 2017 02:51:53 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and people don't normally use more than 6 or so GBs of Mem
30 Mar 2017 02:52:16 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but standard harddrives are like 256+ GBs
30 Mar 2017 02:52:21 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yours is prob 1/2 a Tera
30 Mar 2017 02:52:56 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, LightBot#4090, Welcome @Kenjirologo to LimitlessMc!
30 Mar 2017 02:52:57 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, xD
30 Mar 2017 02:53:01 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, mine is 251
30 Mar 2017 02:53:11 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 251?? wut thats a weird number xD
30 Mar 2017 02:53:22 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, maybe it doesnt let you access the other 5, cause they are system
30 Mar 2017 02:53:38 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well... tbh I have the 256 and a 1 tera in my laptop xD
30 Mar 2017 02:53:54 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I just only want to use the 256 cause its a solid state, and the other one is a regular harddrive
30 Mar 2017 02:53:56 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, im using 169
30 Mar 2017 02:53:58 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, rn
30 Mar 2017 02:54:19 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Im using 216 😄

30 Mar 2017 02:54:36 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, had like 16 earlier today
30 Mar 2017 02:54:41 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but cleared a little up
30 Mar 2017 02:54:50 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, good 😛
30 Mar 2017 02:57:02 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but it looks like you are fine on space
30 Mar 2017 02:57:09 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you don't really need to clean it up
30 Mar 2017 02:57:36 : Cipher, cala, Calamariela#4119, yep 😛
30 Mar 2017 02:57:43 : LimitlessMc, voice-junk, JustinOPGamer#9138, @Crystal4209  u just dont understand rn um sorry

30 Mar 2017 20:37:25 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I can try, but the API was being killed
30 Mar 2017 20:37:30 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but it might be fixed now

30 Mar 2017 20:39:47 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, basically a nice and easy translation book from the language I'm using to the API
30 Mar 2017 20:40:08 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so instead of having to hard code all the API calls and annoying networking things
30 Mar 2017 20:40:25 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, I just have to say new Cleverbot("MY KEY")
30 Mar 2017 20:40:37 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and just ask questions easily with that
30 Mar 2017 20:41:03 : Cipher, cala, Wertfuzzy77#0274, connects my coding to their coding, and the one I was using broke, which is why it didnt work anymore
