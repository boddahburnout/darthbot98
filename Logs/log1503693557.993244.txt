25 Aug 2017 21:37:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It doesn't log as much as the IE version, but it does do the insert/remove/pickup item stuff
25 Aug 2017 21:38:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So hopefully will catch all modded item fuckery
25 Aug 2017 21:38:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, it shouldn't be to much of an issue on SF3
25 Aug 2017 21:38:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but it is good to have none the less

25 Aug 2017 21:40:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so I have had a look around in the prism logs, all of the griefing was done by aaronfi149 alone

25 Aug 2017 21:42:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Cancel that, requires mySQL and can't be bothered to set up another database
25 Aug 2017 21:42:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, We've already got 2 mysql prism databases, the redis market database, and banmanager's mysql one too

25 Aug 2017 21:50:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Can I just ask is this going to be PvE?
25 Aug 2017 21:50:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I think nucleus and GP are just big config files with a bunch of options
25 Aug 2017 21:50:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, PvE or PvP?
25 Aug 2017 21:50:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah
25 Aug 2017 21:50:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I was thinking PvE
25 Aug 2017 21:51:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I think PvE only so like we want mobs to spawn and the like
25 Aug 2017 21:51:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah
25 Aug 2017 21:51:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Firespread etc. on or off?
25 Aug 2017 21:51:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, off
25 Aug 2017 21:51:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Fair enough
25 Aug 2017 21:51:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Spoil sport
25 Aug 2017 21:51:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, no mob damage that sort of thing
25 Aug 2017 21:51:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well we don't have graves
25 Aug 2017 21:51:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so it is fair

25 Aug 2017 21:53:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, we can push the release date back if we need to
25 Aug 2017 21:53:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Wednesday is a better option full stop
25 Aug 2017 21:53:50 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, why do we christians have to do what muslims want us to do >_> if they cant even live acoirding to the rules of the country they visit
25 Aug 2017 21:54:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, it would have been fine but some personal stuff came up unexpectidly

25 Aug 2017 22:02:59 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so a team exists of 5 people
25 Aug 2017 22:03:05 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, So, what does this have to do with religion?

25 Aug 2017 22:04:56 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, since they where like ganging up with all 4 togheter since i asked to speak english
25 Aug 2017 22:05:16 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the rules clearly say that you are forced to speak in a language your whole team understands
25 Aug 2017 22:05:20 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, If the rules **actually** state to speak in English then I understand but, if not then WTF dude.
25 Aug 2017 22:05:43 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I don't have cs:go so I wouldn't know.
25 Aug 2017 22:05:49 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, maybe not all 4 understand english

25 Aug 2017 22:05:58 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, perhaps only 2 or 3 do

25 Aug 2017 22:06:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, nope they all where turkish
25 Aug 2017 22:06:05 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, well if there are 5 players per team
25 Aug 2017 22:06:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and they all even spoke English since they said ok
25 Aug 2017 22:06:16 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, not all turks speak english

25 Aug 2017 22:06:26 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, maybe some of them can speak limited english and cant understand much
25 Aug 2017 22:06:39 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, maybe they're more advanced with turkish
25 Aug 2017 22:06:42 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and if you are queued you use discord or teamspeak not the ingame chat
25 Aug 2017 22:07:24 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the ingame voice chat is there to give information about enemy positions
25 Aug 2017 22:07:29 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and the dmg you did do to them
25 Aug 2017 22:08:20 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but still if you are playing in a queue team of 4 while a complete team has to exist out of 5 people you are forced to speak in a language your whole team knows
25 Aug 2017 22:08:35 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, else you cant give info about the enemy team
25 Aug 2017 22:08:44 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, But, at times that is imossible. So, what then?

25 Aug 2017 22:10:37 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but whats wrong about asking them to speak english since its the main language of the game?
25 Aug 2017 22:10:46 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, because they can speak whatever language they want
25 Aug 2017 22:10:51 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, not really
25 Aug 2017 22:10:53 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, not in this game
25 Aug 2017 22:10:59 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Nothing is wrong with that honestly.
25 Aug 2017 22:11:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if you are playing in a full queued team of turkish people you can speak turkish alot as you want
25 Aug 2017 22:11:40 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but if your team exists 4 out of 5 players who can speak turkish then you are forced to speak english
25 Aug 2017 22:11:42 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, And yes they overreacted but, still. They were already speaking Turkish and there was **most likely** one or two that didn't fully understand English.
25 Aug 2017 22:12:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and most of the time if you queue you use either discord or teamspeak
25 Aug 2017 22:12:19 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, What about this then:
25 Aug 2017 22:12:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats how the world of E-Sports work
25 Aug 2017 22:13:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so I think we can ban items with GP flags ozi
25 Aug 2017 22:13:20 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, but really why do i have to do what they want while they just ignored my question 2 times and then say that i have to shut the fuck up?
25 Aug 2017 22:13:34 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, If one of them speaks Greek and four of them speak Mandrin and **none** of them know English, they are forced to speak English? WTF!
25 Aug 2017 22:13:51 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats how the world of E-Sports works
25 Aug 2017 22:14:19 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, english is the main language of the game
25 Aug 2017 22:14:25 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, doesnt matter
25 Aug 2017 22:14:28 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so if you queue you are forced to speak english in a random team
25 Aug 2017 22:14:31 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, It really doesn't.
25 Aug 2017 22:14:32 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, it dies matter

25 Aug 2017 22:15:00 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if not then just don't use the mic at all
25 Aug 2017 22:15:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I think we would need to do something like /cf interact-item-secondary (item ID)
25 Aug 2017 22:15:34 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, This argument can only end if you show proof of the rules where it states that.
25 Aug 2017 22:15:42 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol
25 Aug 2017 22:16:05 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, why would i have to show the proof of the rules if basically all the E-Sports games have the same rule?
25 Aug 2017 22:16:20 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Because that itself it's even commonly know... :/
25 Aug 2017 22:16:38 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, E-Sports Games: CS:GO, Source, 1.6, League of legends, etc
25 Aug 2017 22:16:48 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, so its not an actual rule defined by the devs?
25 Aug 2017 22:16:52 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, all these games apply to the same rule
25 Aug 2017 22:17:04 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its a rule applied by the game dev and the community
25 Aug 2017 22:17:09 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, It's a Competition rule is what you are saying....
25 Aug 2017 22:17:15 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, its even stated in the eula
25 Aug 2017 22:17:17 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Only during competition...
25 Aug 2017 22:17:31 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Annndddd.... I just looked it up.
25 Aug 2017 22:17:33 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, euhm CS:GO the main game mode is Competitive which means ranking mode
25 Aug 2017 22:17:47 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, RIP Kirito
25 Aug 2017 22:17:51 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, what the heck happened here
25 Aug 2017 22:18:02 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ranking mode -> competitive -> english -> Main Language -> English

25 Aug 2017 22:18:38 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, it states ***NOTHING*** about language

25 Aug 2017 22:18:47 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, :/
25 Aug 2017 22:19:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, lol COMPETITIVV = competition
25 Aug 2017 22:19:12 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, What does CS:GO have to do with anything here..
25 Aug 2017 22:19:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, else it isn't named Competitive
25 Aug 2017 22:19:16 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Kirito...
25 Aug 2017 22:19:39 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, you are forced to speak english to make the team work better togheter
25 Aug 2017 22:19:44 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, Competitive in any game, idc which game, is not competitions.
25 Aug 2017 22:19:51 : PokeIslands, general, ༺༒༻꧁꧁╲⎝⧹⎛⦗ Brady⦘⎞⧸⎠╱꧂꧂༺༒༻#8237, but if 4/5 speak english

25 Aug 2017 22:20:34 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Are you guys seriously arguing over language?
25 Aug 2017 22:20:39 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, if you are queued you either use Discord voice chat or teamspeak
25 Aug 2017 22:21:02 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the ingame voice chat is there to give information to the team about the dmg done and the last known positions of your enemy team
25 Aug 2017 22:21:03 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
25 Aug 2017 22:21:14 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, I only got into this cause Kirito mentioned Religion and I wanted to announce the fact that I'm weird AF and have a religion only six other people have in teh world...
25 Aug 2017 22:21:34 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, So lemme get this straight
25 Aug 2017 22:21:34 : PokeIslands, general, AuroranLily#3763, It turned out not to be about religion. 😭
25 Aug 2017 22:21:43 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well lol they called me a racist for just asking to speak english in the first place >_<

25 Aug 2017 22:28:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, we can test that
25 Aug 2017 22:28:49 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, the GTA series are made in the US which means the main language of the game is English
25 Aug 2017 22:28:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, ah okay, I shall get some staff to test it tomorrow and I can fix the perms as needed
25 Aug 2017 22:28:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Also the info you get when a player signs in - it should tell online staff a player's IP, approximate location, and warnings

25 Aug 2017 22:29:14 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, so the main language of a game depends on where it is developed
