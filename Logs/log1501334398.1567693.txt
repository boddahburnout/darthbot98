29 Jul 2017 16:06:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Yeah he abused the voting glitch
29 Jul 2017 16:06:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, For infinite votes

29 Jul 2017 16:06:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Alright, so it's showing in BanManager's ban list, but not when I run a check on his username

29 Jul 2017 16:08:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Given his massive playtime of like 100 hours, it can probably be chalked up to a mistake - hell, he might already be unbanned - I don't know why it's showing on the list, but not on /bminfo
