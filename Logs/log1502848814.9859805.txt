16 Aug 2017 19:10:58 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, updates, Wertfuzzy77#0274, @​everyone 
Just a quick poll, I have done some work on toggleable commands, but I want to see what you guys want.
16 Aug 2017 19:11:33 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, ⚓Ƹ>⸨Brady⸩<Ʒ⚓#8237, We want bot fuzzy dating sim
16 Aug 2017 19:11:39 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, ⚓Ƹ>⸨Brady⸩<Ʒ⚓#8237, 👍
16 Aug 2017 19:11:42 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @Wertfuzzy77 since your bot can read server info is tehere anyway to make it announce that the server is restarting at the moment it goes offline?
16 Aug 2017 19:12:25 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Wertfuzzy sama
16 Aug 2017 19:12:27 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, Its not constantly reading your server, only when the command is run
16 Aug 2017 19:12:41 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but it wouldnt be too difficult to set something running in the background
16 Aug 2017 19:12:44 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yes?
16 Aug 2017 19:12:46 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Can we get a dating sim
16 Aug 2017 19:12:50 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, wat
16 Aug 2017 19:12:59 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, also, please vote in #updates
16 Aug 2017 19:13:04 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, I wanna flirt with botfuzzy
16 Aug 2017 19:13:04 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, how you mean running in the background? 😄
16 Aug 2017 19:13:11 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, And toggle by channel
16 Aug 2017 19:13:42 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, @KiritoSanPlays I can do it, but its not on the top of my priority list, but i can look into it
16 Aug 2017 19:13:42 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, KiritoSanPlays is afk for reason:

16 Aug 2017 19:13:51 : Proton Gaming Network, infinityevolved, MisterChamp#8562, Sorry should have said before, I managed to get it working, I had a corrupt doc in the mods folder.
16 Aug 2017 19:13:51 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, fair enough 😄
16 Aug 2017 19:14:12 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Be on in like 30
16 Aug 2017 19:14:24 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yo since you have a discord channel make a suggestion section 😮
16 Aug 2017 19:14:34 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, done
16 Aug 2017 19:14:36 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, 😛
16 Aug 2017 19:14:46 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, 😄 would speed up some things 😮
16 Aug 2017 19:15:47 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, see, but like the only problem with running the command per channel, is that you would have to go to everyyyyy channel and run it for each command you want to disable
16 Aug 2017 19:15:52 : PokeIslands, news, KiritoSanPlays#2208, yet again time to help @Wertfuzzy77  😄 please vote on the latest post in the updates section on this discord server https://discord.gg/KdX8MzT
16 Aug 2017 19:16:14 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, meh 😃
16 Aug 2017 19:16:17 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, thats fine by me xD
16 Aug 2017 19:16:18 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, Can't you make it do both
16 Aug 2017 19:16:25 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it sounds nice in practice, being able to make diff channels do diff things
16 Aug 2017 19:16:26 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but eh
16 Aug 2017 19:16:28 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, maybe?
16 Aug 2017 19:16:42 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, dragonbro0803#0985, So servers can disable for all channels OR just for that channel
16 Aug 2017 19:16:57 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, well its just like welcomming should only be posted in bot channel which doesn't allways happen lel
16 Aug 2017 19:17:04 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, Server = whole server
16 Aug 2017 19:17:13 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, follow-up, if I made it do both, would you rather it be 2 commands like ;ctoggle and ;stoggle or like ;toggle [command_name] Server/Channel
16 Aug 2017 19:17:34 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, make it shorter
16 Aug 2017 19:17:44 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so 2 commands?
16 Aug 2017 19:17:56 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ;ctoggle = Channel ;stoggle  = Server Toggle
16 Aug 2017 19:18:01 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, actually, thats ez
16 Aug 2017 19:18:02 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, would make it easier
16 Aug 2017 19:18:13 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, one sec 😛 let me try something
16 Aug 2017 19:18:23 : PokeIslands, general, ⚓Ƹ>⸨Brady⸩<Ʒ⚓#8237, Be on in like 45

16 Aug 2017 19:19:26 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you can do both xD I just lazy and made short ones

16 Aug 2017 19:23:07 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like 1 for music
16 Aug 2017 19:23:09 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and 1 for the games
16 Aug 2017 19:23:21 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, coz if i am correct there is Library -> Source -> Files with links -> Files to save ;afk's and so on
16 Aug 2017 19:23:22 : Botfuzzy77 Living Quarters, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, and 1 for the interactions stuff like ;kill or ;fml
