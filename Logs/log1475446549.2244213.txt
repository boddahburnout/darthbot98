03 Oct 2016 00:09:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, NorthOfTime#1507, @Bringer @Lightning  hey a guy traded me a masterball for my kyog. I found a metagrass like 2 minutes later it glitched (everytime J moved the mouse the camera would move and my mouse would reset to center of screen. If I managed to get the battle tab open itd be a little better but not much.) I finally get it low health and start throwing ultras, only for it to glitch as Im choosing my next ball and throw my master. Anything you can do? Ill give up the meta for the masterball back. I was already gonna leave the battle anyway cause of the glitching.
