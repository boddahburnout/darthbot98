Hey guys,We here at LimitlessMC have noticed the images used on the front page of our website are slightly outdated, we have decided to revitalise a contest that will help us hopefully rejuvenate the website and keep it up to date: The LimitlessMC Screenshot Contest!What is it?Since the map is relatively old, and there are a lot of awesome builds now, we are giving you a chance to submit one screenshot per player of anything on the server. You may change your entry by editing your post as many times as you like, but only submit one post. Since you can only submit one entry, make it as creative as possible!Can I use shaders?Absolutely! Any and all texture packs, shaders, or other visual mods such as animated player mod are all allowed. Do everything you can to make your screenshot as beautiful as possible.Can I edit my shot in Photoshop?Sure! Remember though, it needs to look like a mine...

Hey Everyone!I have seen some players on the server don't know how to breed Pokemon.Well then I decided to post a breeding guide for those that don't know how to breed Pokemon!Getting Started!First off you will need a "Ranch Block".A Ranch Block is a block that enables you to breed your pokemonTo craft a Ranch Block you will need a flower pot,a PC and a piston.Place them in this order:And your done with this part,now its time for:Environment!Before Pokemon can breed they must be in a suitable environment within the Ranch Block's range.This can be achieved if there is a sufficient amount of blocks that are appropriate for the Pokémon's types.To make it easier to construct a suitable environment for breeding, it is possible to place the ranch block in a biome that already contains suitable blocks for the breeding Pokémon.For more information about suitable blocks see this page:http://pixelmonmod.com/w...
