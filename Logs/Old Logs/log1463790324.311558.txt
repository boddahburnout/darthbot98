Wertfuzzy77#0274, ...
Wertfuzzy77#0274, it replaced it right
Wertfuzzy77#0274, i dont understand
Userman#8272, because you do not use regex for html
Userman#8272, get an html parser and do it properly
Wertfuzzy77#0274, doesnt matter, these are the print statements b4 and after, i converted them into simple strings
Wertfuzzy77#0274, i did
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but it removed bold
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and i didnt like that
Userman#8272, you can add the bold after its been parsed
Wertfuzzy77#0274, how
Wertfuzzy77#0274, it removed all HTML things
Wertfuzzy77#0274, left me with a boring string
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and i have no idea where the bold tags were
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !relog
Botfuzzy77#2926, Relogging...
