Jay113355#4999, The website links havent been updated yet
Jay113355#4999, only the /vote's links are good
DonTheBreton#0276, Oh thanks Jay
Wertfuzzy77#0274, do it
Wertfuzzy77#0274, you wont
DonTheBreton#0276, If the server crashes and someone loses their /back location but still has coords is it okay to ask an admin to help?
PacMen#1450, Am I able to post a youtube video link?
PacMen#1450, related to this server
DonTheBreton#0276, I'm not sure but I do know we have a pretty serious problem.
DonTheBreton#0276, Like Jay level issue.
DonTheBreton#0276, I hope I can ping him.
PacMen#1450, what sort of problem? should I be concerned?
DonTheBreton#0276, It seems like fighting boss mobs at towers cause you to crash out when you defeat them
DonTheBreton#0276, You also don't get the reward.
DonTheBreton#0276, Nothing game breaking entirely, but possibly a bigger issue than I understand.
PacMen#1450, that means more time for pokemon catching i guess
Wertfuzzy77#0274, <@86301028575645696>  ya, we will help u
