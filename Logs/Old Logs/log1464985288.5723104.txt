Topheralan#1202, Click general at the top and mute
Topheralan#1202, Then it won't vibrate 
Wertfuzzy77#0274, He said 'I wasnt trying to Force them not to breed, I was warning him that Distributing the HAs will drastically reduce their value. So, i Recommended that He puts up a sign telling guild members to not sell the HAs outside of the Guild'
Wertfuzzy77#0274, or roughly that

Wertfuzzy77#0274, you can try
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well negative codes dont save on my end
Wertfuzzy77#0274, used for my testing
Wertfuzzy77#0274, if you guess a real code, gg you
akinci1903#5072, What happens actually when i do redeem
Dudubidu#6605, Is it a challenge?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, would you like the CS Major explanation, or the English one
Wertfuzzy77#0274, sure
akinci1903#5072, Uh
Dudubidu#6605, Tomorrow the bot will become crazy
akinci1903#5072, English
Wertfuzzy77#0274, considering there are 1,000,000,000 Combos
Wertfuzzy77#0274, i have no fear

Redeems a Given Code for the prize it contains

```
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I have saved a list of Codes
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1st it Runs a part of code to See if is good code
Wertfuzzy77#0274, if is good code, it returns either Half, One, Two, or Five (the diff code values)
Wertfuzzy77#0274, then it runs another part to get a random drop based off of the value
Wertfuzzy77#0274, getting the drop is like 400 ish lines of code on its own
akinci1903#5072, But i dont get the part where it responds to the !redeem command
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 999999999
Wertfuzzy77#0274, oh
Wertfuzzy77#0274, basically, the bot reads every message
Wertfuzzy77#0274, then if it starts with a '!' it treats it s a cmd
Wertfuzzy77#0274, then checks the rest of the word
Wertfuzzy77#0274, if it matchs a cmd, it runs it
Dudubidu#6605, Hello

Wertfuzzy77#0274, v easy to make ones like this
akinci1903#5072, Is the programming on discord
Wertfuzzy77#0274, nah
Wertfuzzy77#0274, its in a Python File
Wertfuzzy77#0274, which is on my PC
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and the Bot runs from a cmd line
akinci1903#5072, And discord supports this python file
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well sort of
Dudubidu#6605, Well guys
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Im using a Python Wrapper
Dudubidu#6605, Good night
Wertfuzzy77#0274, gn
akinci1903#5072, Good night
Wertfuzzy77#0274, So, Discord has an API which allows people to make bots
Wertfuzzy77#0274, however, not in all lanuguages
Wertfuzzy77#0274, However, people make "Wrapper" to allow a Different API to run on a Diff Language
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so, someone made a Python one, and thats what im using
Wertfuzzy77#0274, otherwise would take 1000's of lines of code to do this
Wertfuzzy77#0274, now its only a few hundred
akinci1903#5072, So youre making it in the easier way
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well relatively easy
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I think im at 1.6k lines of Code
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but that also includes the Stuff to extract data from Challonge
Wertfuzzy77#0274, (Which uses another API/Wrapper)
akinci1903#5072, Oh ok
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so its prob about 900 lines of something just for the Bot, and its methods
akinci1903#5072, Well still good job
Wertfuzzy77#0274, If you are interested in learning how to code, I could give you a basic introduction
akinci1903#5072, Thanks so kind of you
akinci1903#5072, I should sleep too, its 12:40am here and im tired af
Wertfuzzy77#0274, lol, get some sleep
