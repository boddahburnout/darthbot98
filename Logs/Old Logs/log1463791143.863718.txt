Sigh yo.. Limitless family i have tried everything i can i guess this crap laptop can't run the pixelmon mod it wont allow me to allocate 2GB RAM to the game and i use 1.5GB but as some of you can see i just log on and boom freezes up nothing i can do... I really wanted to play on this server again but i have no clue what to do now i dont know whether to overclock or something else... wow lol this is depressing XD.... ayo but this is the **STILL THE BEST PIXELMON SERVER</span>! respect to all limitless homies.

**RESPECT</span> ;)
