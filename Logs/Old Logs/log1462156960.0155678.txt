Well, I'm out. I wish I could say that it was a hard decision for me, but it wasn't.  I don't like any of you.

Life is a piece of shit that just loves to kick you in the nuts when you're at your worse.  Then life likes to take salt and pour it into your wounds and spit on you.  If any of you think that life is worth living, let me save you the trouble by saying it totally fucking isn't.  You're better off ending it while you're young than suffering through it until you're old.

Fuck you all.</div>
