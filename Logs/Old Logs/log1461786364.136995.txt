DonTheBreton#0276, It's really odd the the server was having those issues.
DonTheBreton#0276, It didn't look like it was skipping any ticks.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, we are looking into it on our end
JustinOPGamer#9138, so whats happening with server wert ?
DonTheBreton#0276, I'm not sure if this helps, but one of the easiest ways in game for a person to see if the server is lagging vs. the  player is to watch the moon or the sun.
DonTheBreton#0276, If it skips, it's skipping ticks. That wasn't happening this time.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, We are restarting it rn, should be up shortly
JustinOPGamer#9138, ok
DonTheBreton#0276, Oh hmm
DonTheBreton#0276, I know what this is.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ?
DonTheBreton#0276, May I speak with you in private Wert?
JustinOPGamer#9138, it says authentication serveres r down
JustinOPGamer#9138, it back'
JustinOPGamer#9138, it wont accept people for long tho
JustinOPGamer#9138, wert I will be back on in a sec
