Bakafishy#0380, so does the trivia question pool ask anything about berries?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, i can make it
Wertfuzzy77#0274, what kind of questions?
Bakafishy#0380, Type resist berries, stat up berries, ev training berries, restorative berries and confuse some pokemon,
Bakafishy#0380, that*
Wertfuzzy77#0274, example of a question?
Bakafishy#0380, A Quiet-natured Bulbasaur consumes a berry to restore its HP but then becomes confused. What berry did it consume?
Bakafishy#0380, The answer of which would be Mago Berry.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, why does it need to be quiet?
Bakafishy#0380, any nature that lowers speed
Bakafishy#0380, will cause that berry to inflict confusion on consumption

Bakafishy#0380, Another example: What berry, when consumed, reduces damage taken from Ice-type moves on that turn? Answer: Yache Berry
Wertfuzzy77#0274, that kind of question would be better

Bakafishy#0380, yeah the Mago berry question could be turned into: What berry, when consumed, confuses Pokemon with speed-lowering natures?
