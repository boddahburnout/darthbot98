Botfuzzy77#2926, **The Problems With Claims.**
#9327 by Qu2ntin
 Sat Mar 19, 2016 4:34 pm 
------------------------------------
**Okay so i have been playing this server for almost a year and the one thing that i hate about this server is that when we create a claim and move houses and have no idea that claims are still at our old homes/bases and then we have 3 claims used up which we need to use for our new bases but we have no way to find what cords they are located at or anyway to delete them without standing in them. This is why i am suggesting that we should have something like /claimlist which gives us the cords where the claims we have are at or how far away they are or add something that enables us to delete all claims without standing in them or standing near them at all. I just wanted to suggest this because for ages i have had 3 claims located at a place where i don't know where it is and i have to live with 3 less claim chunks which i could use to build ranches or build a house and it gets me very angry that i cant even find a way to delete or locate these claims at all. Please take this suggestion into consideration jay because this really annoys me really really really much and i like this server and having claims where i don't know where they are just makes me feel like there is no point playing this server because i don't even know where the 3 fucking claims are and it just gets me seriously angry - <span style="color: #FF00FF">Qu2ntin****

Botfuzzy77#2926, **Saturday Tournaments**
#9239 by Wertfuzzy77

------------------------------------
So, after a few trial runs, and some rule tweaking, I think we are ready for some more Official Limitless MC Tournaments.
You can read below, or just click the Link to go to the Tournament Site.
**Link:**
http://limitlessmc.challonge.com/">http://limitlessmc.challonge.com/

Tournaments will be hosted most Saturdays Afternoons, although there might be some special Tournaments for Holidays and such. I encourage you to join as it will be a lot of fun, and you will have the Opportunity to see how you rank up on the server. 
Along with having fun, Prizes will be given out at most (not all) tournaments. These prizes might include things from TMs/ingame Money to Legendary Pokemon.

At the Moment, Tournaments will be Hosted at /warp Arena, which is the Spawn Arena. I will be constructing an Arena solely for these Tournaments, so be sure to check in and see how the progress is coming. (I will post Pictures here). 

Anyways, I hope you enjoy these Tournaments, and if you have any Suggestions for Tournament Themes or Wish to donate Prizes for a Tournament, Please Message me on the Forums or Ingame.

DonTheBreton#0276, In my experience if we ever ping Jay and his tag up in the right goes to green he's got it covered.
DonTheBreton#0276, Even if he doesn't say anything.
DrSmiley72#5983, yeha i saw he was yellow till you pinged himthe first time
DonTheBreton#0276, I just hesitate to assume.
DonTheBreton#0276, I've told him in the past to not hesitate to let me know if I'm bothering him so I feel confident he'd tell me.
