MajeecWizurd#7777, HOLY COW THAT ALOT OF STUFF
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
MajeecWizurd#7777, oops caps
Wertfuzzy77#0274, tis a 2k book tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so has a 19% chance for a pack
Wertfuzzy77#0274, the $500 has like a .3%
MajeecWizurd#7777, ya makes sense
Wertfuzzy77#0274, best prize is the Special prize
Wertfuzzy77#0274, worth about 22k
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Tis a Shiny Legendary
MajeecWizurd#7777, let me guess it had legendaries
MajeecWizurd#7777, yup
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Legendarys are averaged as 9.32k drops
Wertfuzzy77#0274, that $500 had a .2% to drop legend
MajeecWizurd#7777, than how many legendaries are in the 22k one
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 2k has a 2% chance
MajeecWizurd#7777, tjust one
Wertfuzzy77#0274, only 1 legend
Wertfuzzy77#0274, shiny tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Its the Legendary of the Month
MajeecWizurd#7777, wow when is the next bok hunt
Wertfuzzy77#0274, this month is Suicune
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so Special is a Shiny Suicine
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well... im only testing the system
Wertfuzzy77#0274, gonna go in full effect after Noob tourney
MajeecWizurd#7777, oh is this a new thing
Wertfuzzy77#0274, yes
Wertfuzzy77#0274, made it yesterday-today
MajeecWizurd#7777, am i the first person to claim it
Wertfuzzy77#0274, nah
Wertfuzzy77#0274, like the 3rd or so
MajeecWizurd#7777, aw still cool
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1st person to claim 2 tho
MajeecWizurd#7777, yay
MajeecWizurd#7777, wat did the others get
Wertfuzzy77#0274, actally, 2nd person
Wertfuzzy77#0274, rdrnnr#4589 won Lucky egg with Code 118744918
MajeecWizurd#7777 won Destiny Knot with Code 621126714
MajeecWizurd#7777 won Wise Glasses with Code 952034324
MajeecWizurd#7777, wtf lol
MajeecWizurd#7777, some code stuff
Wertfuzzy77#0274, there are 2 more books I dropped that havnt been used yet
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
MajeecWizurd#7777, right now
Wertfuzzy77#0274, just pay attention to name and drop
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya 2 books are un accounted for
Wertfuzzy77#0274, dropped em in a drop party
Wertfuzzy77#0274, havnt been claimed
Wertfuzzy77#0274, one was a 1k drop
MajeecWizurd#7777, oh ya porbably just lazy people or it may have depawnsed
MajeecWizurd#7777, nobody picked up
Wertfuzzy77#0274, it was a drop party, so it went in the crowd
Wertfuzzy77#0274, someone got it
MajeecWizurd#7777, lol someone dropped it cuz they ddwant a book in there inv and they wanted an item
Wertfuzzy77#0274, lol
Wertfuzzy77#0274, prob
MajeecWizurd#7777, thats a shame if its like that
Wertfuzzy77#0274, The cool thing is that the Books are worth exactly the amount it says
MajeecWizurd#7777, lol
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause a $500 book has an excpected drop value of exactly $500
Wertfuzzy77#0274, same with 1k, 2k, and 5k
MajeecWizurd#7777, and the unexpected is over 500
Wertfuzzy77#0274, or below
Wertfuzzy77#0274, basically if you open 100 $500 books, you should average $50,000 in stuff
MajeecWizurd#7777, ah
Wertfuzzy77#0274, some might drop less/more, but average is 500
MajeecWizurd#7777, but you might get lucky and get one that 22K woth
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, .1% tho
MajeecWizurd#7777, its a cool system
Wertfuzzy77#0274, thx
MajeecWizurd#7777, lol same as the mball ofr voting
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but always has a prize
Wertfuzzy77#0274, So im replaceing all of my tourney prizes with these Books
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I think 1st place is a 5k book
Wertfuzzy77#0274, has 7% of Special prize
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 56% of the time will drop money $1k-5k
MajeecWizurd#7777, ya i think its a good idea
Wertfuzzy77#0274, plus, then you can trade the book for its value instead of redeeming it
MajeecWizurd#7777, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, you can sell in market or something
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so instead of risking it, just opt for the money value
MajeecWizurd#7777, ya i would do that
MajeecWizurd#7777, if i had known it was an item thing i owuld have sold them earlier lol no offense
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Pretty high chance of a shiny Legend tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, the $500 one, prob def
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause no one wants the items
Wertfuzzy77#0274, oh, $500 dollar one does have the Highest MBall drop tho
MajeecWizurd#7777, well that changes things
MajeecWizurd#7777, i would rather take an mball chance than sell them
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 5% chance for a MBall in $500 Prize
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 4.5 in 1k
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 2.8 in 2k
Wertfuzzy77#0274, .3% in 5k
MajeecWizurd#7777, lol why does it get lower the higher the price goes
MajeecWizurd#7777, wait actually it makes sense
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Cause Mball is classified as an Item
MajeecWizurd#7777, higher chance of other more valuable things
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and Items have a lower chance to drop the better the ticket
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 98.5 - $500
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 88.5 - 1k
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 56 - 2k
MajeecWizurd#7777, when is the next book hunt
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 6 - 5k
Wertfuzzy77#0274, idk
MajeecWizurd#7777, lookin forward to it
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I think this should increase the Discord Traffic
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause this is a pretty good messaging system
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause bots OP
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !help
MajeecWizurd#7777, lolya i just downloaded the app to redeem the codes lol
