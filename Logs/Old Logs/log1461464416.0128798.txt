Nerd#8248, http://pastebin.com/jUUijwx4
Nerd#8248, I mean at least it said I retrieved articuno with my spamming of the R button before it froze in the next 3 seconds
Wertfuzzy77#0274, it didnt update your java
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1.8.0_25
Nerd#8248, what
Nerd#8248, it said I did when I checked
Wertfuzzy77#0274, [OptiFine] Java: 1.8.0_25, Oracle Corporation
Wertfuzzy77#0274, must not have
Wertfuzzy77#0274, are you using a launcher?
Nerd#8248, for minecraft?
Nerd#8248, or java
Nerd#8248, going to assume java because minecraft is already a launcher but ya
Nerd#8248, I am using launcher for java
Nerd#8248, on firefox to even get it
Nerd#8248, the wierd thing is when I check my java version I see this when it is done, You have the recommended Java installed (Version 8 Update 91)
Nerd#8248, I have an idea that could somehow possibly magicly work, I got a minecraft launcher from the website again and clicked repair, maybe it will use the new java now with that even when I uninstalled the old versions
Wertfuzzy77#0274, try restarting your computer
Nerd#8248, that might work also, ya
Nerd#8248, if this doesn't work then I will restart
