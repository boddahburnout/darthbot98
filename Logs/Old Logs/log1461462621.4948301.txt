Botfuzzy77#2926, Starting up...
Botfuzzy77#2926, Loaded with Version 0.5.1
Nerd#8248, that's what I could get because when I went to .minecraft there was still nothing in there so I just pasted what I saw from the launcher
Wertfuzzy77#0274, CodeChickenLib-1.8
Nerd#8248, what's that mean?
Nerd#8248, *whats
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Make sure you have the right version
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause the error report says 1.8, not 1.8.9
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !redeem 222312751
Botfuzzy77#2926, That is an USED Code
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !redeem 222312751
Botfuzzy77#2926, That is an USED Code
Nerd#8248, i'm positive I do, maybe I need to upgrade forge to newest 1.8.9?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 675006812
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !redeem 675006812
Botfuzzy77#2926, That is an USED Code
Wertfuzzy77#0274, maybe, but if pixelmon works on it, i dont think you need to update
Nerd#8248, WAIT, I found it for some reason it has a 1.8 folder and inside of it is codechickenlib-1.8
Nerd#8248, should I delete the whole 1.8 folder from mods
Wertfuzzy77#0274, eh
Wertfuzzy77#0274, kinda risky
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I also found this
Nerd#8248, I'll just delete what's inside
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 1.8.0_25 for your Java version
Nerd#8248, oh so updrage java
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, try that
Nerd#8248, *upgrade
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause you are a little out dated
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !shutdown
Botfuzzy77#2926, Ok :(
Botfuzzy77#2926, Gooodbye cruel world
