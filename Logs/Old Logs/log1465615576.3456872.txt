B3TAMAN#5712, it's head to tail because some pokes are also measure head to tail
B3TAMAN#5712, when they should be shorter
D3NSH1N#8702, Well, thats how you measure it anyway
B3TAMAN#5712, some are measure head to tail if the tail measure past the feet
D3NSH1N#8702, Otherwise you measure sprites
D3NSH1N#8702, Wich differ from gen to gen
B3TAMAN#5712, but others are measured head to toe
D3NSH1N#8702, Cause belly to back is shorter
B3TAMAN#5712, here lemme get some examples... from this vid i watched
D3NSH1N#8702, The definition is "the longest distance you can cover in a straight line"

Botfuzzy77#2926, *From The Other Side*
TheMajesticSeal#2289, cant say
D3NSH1N#8702, Talking about Shiny-Species combination
TheMajesticSeal#2289, zygarde
AlphaBit#3869, since the rest of the list has serpentine bodies
D3NSH1N#8702, Like Shiny Mew for example
TheMajesticSeal#2289, impossible to get shiny zygarde
TheMajesticSeal#2289, there
B3TAMAN#5712, Rarest poke is a shine spinda
B3TAMAN#5712, no
B3TAMAN#5712, wait
D3NSH1N#8702, Thats a stupit answer
D3NSH1N#8702, And yes, its Spinda
D3NSH1N#8702, Shiny one to be exact
B3TAMAN#5712, a second spinda that has the same marks as another one and is shiny
B3TAMAN#5712, is the rarest poke
D3NSH1N#8702, <@!176394182083084289>  many pokes are shiny locked
Ajzombie1#5783, lol
TheMajesticSeal#2289, ik

B3TAMAN#5712, yeah
D3NSH1N#8702, 4,294,967,295*2 patterns
B3TAMAN#5712, salamence is 4'11 but would be "taller" if it was measured from head to tail it would be bigger
D3NSH1N#8702, Would it be tho?
B3TAMAN#5712, and Milotic is 20'04 feet tall
B3TAMAN#5712, again measure head to tail
B3TAMAN#5712, No who do you think is tallest Usaring Beartic or Pangoro?
B3TAMAN#5712, Now*
D3NSH1N#8702, Weedle is the only poke on that can't learn a normal type move.
B3TAMAN#5712, lol
D3NSH1N#8702, At least prior to gen6
B3TAMAN#5712, what is panchams evolution called?
D3NSH1N#8702, Pangoro
B3TAMAN#5712, ok just making sure

B3TAMAN#5712, so Usaring is 5'11 Beartic is 8'06 and Pangoro is 6'11

Wertfuzzy77#0274, the weedle one?
D3NSH1N#8702, ye

D3NSH1N#8702, As I said, no clue about that one.
D3NSH1N#8702, But still the question is valid.
D3NSH1N#8702, Since its not based on that Kyurem
D3NSH1N#8702, And techically speaking, Kyurem WAS a wild pokemon
D3NSH1N#8702, It wasnt caught, It was controlled
B3TAMAN#5712, true
D3NSH1N#8702, Do the balls from the 1st Movie have a name btw?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, alright i tired

D3NSH1N#8702, What about them B3ta?
B3TAMAN#5712, Flints infernape has flareblitz
B3TAMAN#5712, but it learns that at lvl 68
D3NSH1N#8702, hm
B3TAMAN#5712, and flints infernape is only lvl 61
D3NSH1N#8702, Not sure if thats illegal
D3NSH1N#8702, Chimchar should learn it sooner
D3NSH1N#8702, Or monferno
B3TAMAN#5712, while flints infernape is more experianced than ashes
B3TAMAN#5712, ashes infernape also has flare blitz
D3NSH1N#8702, Wait, you are confusing me.
D3NSH1N#8702, Anime or Game?
