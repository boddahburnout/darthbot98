Nerd#8248, I can try again and see if console will open or if I can play
Jay113355#4999, Make sure the optifine works?
Nerd#8248, I opened it without pixelmon and it seemed just fine, as soon as I add pixelmon is when everything goes wrong
Nerd#8248, same thing vice versa
Nerd#8248, pixelmon fine on it's own, add optifine I crash
Nerd#8248, http://pastebin.com/0epjJ3cN already took a small peek to see if I saw something and my Java says it STILL hasn't updated
Nerd#8248, I'M SO CONFUSED
Wertfuzzy77#0274, lol, i have no idea then
Wertfuzzy77#0274, wait, are you using a launcher?
Nerd#8248, for what?
Nerd#8248, The Java
Nerd#8248, it only gives me a launcher to use for it
Wertfuzzy77#0274, no, for MC
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, i gtg
Wertfuzzy77#0274, if you have a MC launcher, there should be a setting menu
Wertfuzzy77#0274, you might have to change java version there
