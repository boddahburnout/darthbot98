Hello, I recently started playing on limitless a lot again and I couldn't help but notice some things that could be improved upon in the server. I understand you probably have lots of stuff to do so I'll try and make this as quick and easy to read as possible. I wrote this in one go on my phone, instead of going back to fill in gaps, so if there are errors, please forgive me.

1.) **<span style="text-decoration: underline">Safari Zone**** - Its shit (period). I understand it's just a place to access all biomes quickly but seriously?

**Okay so i have been playing this server for almost a year and the one thing that i hate about this server is that when we create a claim and move houses and have no idea that claims are still at our old homes/bases and then we have 3 claims used up which we need to use for our new bases but we have no way to find what cords they are located at or anyway to delete them without standing in them. This is why i am suggesting that we should have something like /claimlist which gives us the cords where the claims we have are at or how far away they are or add something that enables us to delete all claims without standing in them or standing near them at all. I just wanted to suggest this because for ages i have had 3 claims located at a place where i don't know where it is and i have to live with 3 less claim chunks which i could use to build ranches or build a house and it gets ...
