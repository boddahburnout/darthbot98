Hey Everyone!I have seen some players on the server don't know how to breed Pokemon.Well then I decided to post a breeding guide for those that don't know how to breed Pokemon!Getting Started!First off you will need a "Ranch Block".A Ranch Block is a block that enables you to breed your pokemonTo craft a Ranch Block you will need a flower pot,a PC and a piston.Place them in this order:And your done with this part,now its time for:Environment!Before Pokemon can breed they must be in a suitable environment within the Ranch Block's range.This can be achieved if there is a sufficient amount of blocks that are appropriate for the Pokémon's types.To make it easier to construct a suitable environment for breeding, it is possible to place the ranch block in a biome that already contains suitable blocks for the breeding Pokémon.For more information about suitable blocks see this page:http://pixelmonmod.com/w...
