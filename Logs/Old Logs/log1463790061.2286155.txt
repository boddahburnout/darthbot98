Well as the title said, my computer ran into some trouble, it turns on but doesn't actually fully start up but anyways I will not be able to play for a while till it gets fixed, maybe 1 to 2 weeks, I sad <img alt=":(" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" title="Sad"/>

BTW: congratulations ruler on getting mod!  <img alt=";)" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" title="Wink"/>
Userman#8272, what are you trying to do?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, remove <img alt=";)" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" title="Wink"/> and replace with ";)"
Wertfuzzy77#0274, it says it is working on my end :/
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but something is going wrong
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and it isnt removing it
Userman#8272, are you using regex to find and replace?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ```
py
def cleanLine(line):
    print('cleaning')
    if('<span style="font-weight: bold">' in line):
        line = line.replace('<span style="font-weight: bold">', '')
        line = "**" + line + "**"
    print(line)
    line = line.replace('<img alt=";)" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" title="Wink"/>', ';)')
    line = line.replace('<img alt=":(" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" title="Sad"/>', ':(')
    print(line)
    return line
```
Wertfuzzy77#0274, simple replace
Wertfuzzy77#0274, bold works just fine
