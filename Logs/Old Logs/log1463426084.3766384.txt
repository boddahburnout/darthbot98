Wertfuzzy77#0274, let me know if any of the Prices are off
MGirard#3037, Awesome. Makes a good guide for selling TMs too. I'll have to show my friends so they know what to expect from prize tickets.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya
Wertfuzzy77#0274, this is only the Tier 3 TMs tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so only like 1/2 of em
MGirard#3037, I could go through and see what I think of the prices, but it would just be subjective based on the number of items I've found so far.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ya, these are my best guesses tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so even if i average your value and mine, it would be closer
MGirard#3037, I'll look through them and make a list of the ones I think are off. I'm not gonna have a clue on the TM prices, though. It would be awesome if the market was logging prices on successful sales that could be averaged for this purpose.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, would take alot of storage space, i brought it up to Jay b4
MGirard#3037, That's surprising, that it would take that much storage space.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, tbh, idk how much, but that was his responce
Wertfuzzy77#0274, @everyone I want to get Atleast 15 Active Members in Cipher, so if you see anyone who you think would like to join, please let me know!
MGirard#3037, In the building pack, those are just Quartz and not Quartz Blocks?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, quartz blocks
MGirard#3037, Okay. It just says "Stack of Quartz".
Wertfuzzy77#0274, really? i fix
Wertfuzzy77#0274, one
Wertfuzzy77#0274, done*
ItzFuzeM8#0498, and me
Wertfuzzy77#0274, hello
Botfuzzy77#2926, *From The Otherside*
ItzFuzeM8#0498, i might have
ItzFuzeM8#0498, wrong thingy
MGirard#3037, Gold ingots are being valued at about $20 each, and since rare candies can be made with 8 of those as the most uncommon ingredient, their prices should be linked. The price of rare candies (currently $400) should be reduced by 50% or more.
MGirard#3037, Power Belt and Macho Brace are missing from the Training Pack.
MGirard#3037, Under legendaries: Raikou is listed 4 times, Kyogre twice, and the following may be missing missing: Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Entei, Regice, Registeel, Regirock, Regigigas, Ho-oh.
MGirard#3037, So far, here's what I think:
MGirard#3037, Destiny Knot: $100 -> $400
Focus Sash: $300 -> $500
Leftovers: $400 -> $750
Exp. Share: $600 -> $350
Lucky Egg: $500 -> $350
Ditto: $750 -> $2000+
Ranch Block: $50 -> $150
Diamond Hammer: $150 -> $75
Rare Candy: $400 -> $100 
Diamond: $25 -> $35
Power Anklet: $350 -> $500
Power Band: $350 -> $200
Power Weight: $350 -> $500
Pixelmon Gem Block: $100 -> $35
Matholive#5642, Mank
That-Guy-Gilly#6803, go appeal it at the link given bud
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Sorry, was afk for a bit
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ok, On my end Rare Candy = Eight_Rare_Candy, and I forgot to change the actual string value to say that it is 8 of em
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Just added Power Belt, and I didnt att Macho Brace because it isnt a Tier 3 Boss Drop
Wertfuzzy77#0274, As for Legendaryies, I only have available what ones I currently have available to drop, so this will change as i drop them or get more
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Destiny Knot is Craftable, so should be cheap
Wertfuzzy77#0274, As for those Items, I updated the Prices to be about Average of what I though and what you think, hope they look better
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Also, with those Changes the Average Item is now EXACTLY $500
Wertfuzzy77#0274, which is cool
Wertfuzzy77#0274, any opinion on the TM pricing?
