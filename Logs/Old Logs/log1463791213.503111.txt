Sigh yo.. Limitless family i have tried everything i can i guess this crap laptop can't run the pixelmon mod it wont allow me to allocate 2GB RAM to the game and i use 1.5GB but as some of you can see i just log on and boom freezes up nothing i can do... I really wanted to play on this server again but i have no clue what to do now i dont know whether to overclock or something else... wow lol this is depressing XD.... ayo but this is the **STILL THE BEST PIXELMON SERVER**! respect to all limitless homies.

So, after a few trial runs, and some rule tweaking, I think we are ready for some more Official Limitless MC Tournaments.
You can read below, or just click the Link to go to the Tournament Site.
**Link:**
<a class="postlink" href="http://limitlessmc.challonge.com/">http://limitlessmc.challonge.com/</a>

Tournaments will be hosted most Saturdays Afternoons, although there might be some special Tournaments for Holidays and such. I encourage you to join as it will be a lot of fun, and you will have the Opportunity to see how you rank up on the server. 
Along with having fun, Prizes will be given out at most (not all) tournaments. These prizes might include things from TMs/ingame Money to Legendary Pokemon.

At the Moment, Tournaments will be Hosted at /warp Arena, which is the Spawn Arena. I will be constructing an Arena solely for these Tournaments, so be sure to check in and see...
