Wertfuzzy77#0274, hello
Botfuzzy77#2926, *From The Other Side*
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, in task manager, is says 0% CPU and 0.5 MBs
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but i would assume almost nothing, as by bot doesnt run anything in the background <@128244218761183232>
Wertfuzzy77#0274, anyways, gtg
Ku Klux Klan#7098, why no music?
Ku Klux Klan#7098, i want music
Jay113355#4999, I was going to say we could run him on the server so hes available 24/7
GuardiaN#3763, ^
Wertfuzzy77#0274, awesome :D, but would i be able to update him? cause i patch him pretty frequently
Wertfuzzy77#0274, most weekends i update his code and add new things
GuardiaN#3763, jay
GuardiaN#3763, if you wanted only music, you can re-authorise the bot and disable him messaging in channels
Jay113355#4999, Yeah you would have a login to the server and would have to upload his files and restart him
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, he has a simple restart cmd
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !restart
DonTheBreton#0276, Does this bot belong to someone?
Tigranasouras#6715, ...
Wertfuzzy77#0274, !relog
