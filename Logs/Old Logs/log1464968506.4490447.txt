akinci1903#5072, Uhh whats wrong with ruler?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, 'He's a power hungry cunt' ' had to talk to gil before bc ruler oversteps his bounds' 'He kills legendaries when they spawn
Just a douchebag' 'He is trying to stop joe from breeding ha for the guild '
Wertfuzzy77#0274, that about sums it up
Dudubidu#6605, wert what do u think about it?
akinci1903#5072, Hmm
akinci1903#5072, Was gonna ask the same
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I think im gonna talk to him, and tell him to go home
Dudubidu#6605, lol
akinci1903#5072, Lel
Topheralan#1202, Lol we love you <@!134441036905840640> 
Wertfuzzy77#0274, @here can i get a clarifiaction about the conversation with ruler about breeding
Wertfuzzy77#0274, need alittle more on the specifics on the convo
Dudubidu#6605, i wasnt on
Topheralan#1202, He said that he was going to have a talk with Joe about his breeding. I asked him why and he said bc joes shouldn't be soreading around HAs, it's bad for server economy. I told him that Joe wasn't breaking any rules and that HA hunting is his favorite thing and don't try to take that away from him. 
Topheralan#1202, And I said it was only for guild members and he said guild can be disbanded. 
akinci1903#5072, Waaat
Dudubidu#6605, guys
Dudubidu#6605, we should start selling has to everyone in the server
Dudubidu#6605, so he shuts the fuck up
Wertfuzzy77#0274, nah, dont to that lol, cause i dont want everyone to OP, i will never win ;-;
Topheralan#1202, What pusses me off was that he scolded me about letting someone challenge me with a lvl 21 poke bc it leveled up during battle. Happened to Gil but he could roll the poke back, I couldn't. So I let the kid challenge again. 
Topheralan#1202, Pisses lol
Dudubidu#6605, he warned me
Dudubidu#6605, cuz i accepted a lvl 62 in a gym battle
Dudubidu#6605, the child was whining cuz he was gonna win with that
Dudubidu#6605, other pokes were lvl 20
Dudubidu#6605, i literally 1hit his lvl 62
akinci1903#5072, lol
Dudubidu#6605, "thats an easy way to lose the title"
Dudubidu#6605, i didnt write fuck off just cuz he is a mod
Topheralan#1202, I was just trying to be a nice gl and let the kid continue. I don't need ruler "doing his job" and reprimanding me. 
Dudubidu#6605, and he can ban me
Topheralan#1202, lol me too <@180734543488090123> 
Topheralan#1202, I told him a gym rule isn't a server rule and I wasn't breaking any server rules. 
Dudubidu#6605, "mature server"
Dudubidu#6605, rip
akinci1903#5072, ^
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, i gtg, ill deal with this later
Topheralan#1202, Okei
