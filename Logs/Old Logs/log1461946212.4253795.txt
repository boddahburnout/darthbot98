DonTheBreton#0276, With no way to grow berries and several other items being nearly exclusively obtainable via forage, I wonder if there's any chance we could enable it for the server.
DonTheBreton#0276, That or convince Pixelmon to add berry growing.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, berrys are really common from boss drops tho
Wertfuzzy77#0274, what else can you only get frmo foraging?
DonTheBreton#0276, How often are you going to get the berry you need. Especially considering they're consumed on use.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, not in trainer battles
DonTheBreton#0276, That's good to know. Good Rod, Super Rod, berries, wither skull, evolution shards,  bottles of enchanting, slimeballs, obsidian, and prismarine are all kind of annoying to acquire otherwise but can be gotten with forage.
DonTheBreton#0276, Oh and aluminium
Wertfuzzy77#0274, fishing rods are being planned to go into a spawn shop
DonTheBreton#0276, Yeah I spoke with Gilman about that yesterday.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, wither skulls drop from cubone
DonTheBreton#0276, Just seems a shame there's an entire function of the mod we can't use ya know.
Wertfuzzy77#0274, obsidian is ez from fire stone tool
