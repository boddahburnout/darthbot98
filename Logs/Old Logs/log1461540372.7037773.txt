Jay113355#4999, I made a bot chat so the main chat wasn't spammed
Wertfuzzy77#0274, was testing
Jay113355#4999, So that people could mute the botchat
Wertfuzzy77#0274, they still can, all cmds are done bot chat
Wertfuzzy77#0274, you cant do anything here
Wertfuzzy77#0274, so... what do you feel is spamming, and i should fix?
