CoolBloo#3806, need help
CoolBloo#3806, This book that IamLucario won didnt work tht he sold and I bought it off the market which doesnt work again XD
DonTheBreton#0276, Should be "a" not "an" because the word used starts with a y consonant sound not the u vowel sound like in ugly or unused.
Topheralan#1202, Yea, it sketches the move. So even if a poke switches you'll copy the last move used. 
Topheralan#1202, I've always just battled someone 1v1 so the baton pas fails anyway. 
Dudubidu#6605, What about spore?
Dudubidu#6605, Spam it till i eake up?
Topheralan#1202, Yep
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I could but the message is actually print("{} is an {} Code".format(code, response))
Wertfuzzy77#0274, which basically means it just fills in the blanks
CoolBloo#3806, hey wert this code not working

CoolBloo#3806, .....
CoolBloo#3806, Are used code books allowed to be sold after used
Wertfuzzy77#0274, they are worth nothing, so no?
CoolBloo#3806, then...
CoolBloo#3806, no refunds now?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, well, they can be sold, but should not be worth the value of the ticket
