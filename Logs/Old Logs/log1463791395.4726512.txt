------------------------------------
So, after a few trial runs, and some rule tweaking, I think we are ready for some more Official Limitless MC Tournaments.
You can read below, or just click the Link to go to the Tournament Site.

Tournaments will be hosted most Saturdays Afternoons, although there might be some special Tournaments for Holidays and such. I encourage you to join as it will be a lot of fun, and you will have the Opportunity to see how you rank up on the server. 
Along with having fun, Prizes will be given out at most (not all) tournaments. These prizes might include things from TMs/ingame Money to Legendary Pokemon.

At the Moment, Tournaments will be Hosted at /warp Arena, which is the Spawn Arena. I will be constructing an Arena solely for these Tournaments, so be sure to check in and see how the progress is coming. (...
