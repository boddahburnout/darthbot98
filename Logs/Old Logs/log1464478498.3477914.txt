Nerokin#3586, That spammed in game
Wertfuzzy77#0274, cmds are getting really, really, really, really, really long now tho lol
Wertfuzzy77#0274, rip
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I wish i could have a Section that Would not go IG :/
Wertfuzzy77#0274, but cant really
Nerokin#3586, Hey <@151437497191235585> You around?
Nerokin#3586, I'd like the discord mod now

Nerokin#3586, Too many characters at once
Topheralan#1202, Maybe I don't want discord2mc.... Lol
Nerokin#3586, It's the way the person made the mod
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I hope they Improve it, cause its a Really cool idea
Nerokin#3586, No way to assign aliases at all
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I might even take a look at the source code, to see how it works
Wertfuzzy77#0274, and tinker with it
Nerokin#3586, Like for this server, it has a pretty long name
Nerokin#3586, LimitlessMC Cipher
Wertfuzzy77#0274, Fixed
Wertfuzzy77#0274, only 'Cipher' Now
Nerokin#3586, That's actually alot better in game
Nerokin#3586, I don't really think it needs to say "[Discord]" in game though
Nerokin#3586, Or just send chat to a new GUI that happens to be on screen
Wertfuzzy77#0274, that would be cool
Wertfuzzy77#0274, like a 2nd chat window
Wertfuzzy77#0274, wish me luck
Nerokin#3586, Can anyone access 5zig.eu?
Nerokin#3586, @Wert Good luck
Wertfuzzy77#0274, I am no longer Wertfuzzy77
Nerokin#3586, Alright, I got it open in the wayback time machine
Wertfuzzy77#0274, ?
Wertfuzzy77#0274, wtb Time Machine
