18 Aug 2017 19:08:09 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, @KiritoSanPlays which mod are we using

18 Aug 2017 19:08:49 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, i has a question
18 Aug 2017 19:08:54 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, why 2.5 and not 3? XD
18 Aug 2017 19:09:00 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Literally just talking about that
18 Aug 2017 19:09:06 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, FYI, i dont know what the difference is lol
18 Aug 2017 19:09:23 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, 2.5 was easier to get up due to re-using our existing plugins/configs
18 Aug 2017 19:09:40 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, ohhh
18 Aug 2017 19:12:52 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, Yea I'm fixing it
18 Aug 2017 19:13:10 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, I figured it out, but if you are putting it on your server then decrease spawn rates
18 Aug 2017 19:13:13 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, Major lag
18 Aug 2017 19:13:15 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, O.o i have v1.1 installed but i have no idea which version we're using o.O

18 Aug 2017 20:01:51 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, The best mathematical equation I have ever seen: 1 cross + 3 nails= 4 given.
18 Aug 2017 20:02:28 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, mine is the square root of -1 two cubed epsilon pi
18 Aug 2017 20:03:07 : PokeIslands, general, Litten~Zane~#2042, lol
18 Aug 2017 20:03:18 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, dafuq XD
18 Aug 2017 20:03:30 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, which translates to i 8 all the pi
18 Aug 2017 20:03:40 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Wat
18 Aug 2017 20:03:46 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Light#6734, ^ yes wut
18 Aug 2017 20:03:48 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number as it can't exist
18 Aug 2017 20:03:56 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, so we represent it as an i
18 Aug 2017 20:04:01 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, 2 cubed is the number 8
18 Aug 2017 20:04:02 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Wertfuzzy77#0274, No not that part
18 Aug 2017 20:04:13 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, epsilon is the greek symbol that meens sum of
18 Aug 2017 20:04:16 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, or all of
18 Aug 2017 20:04:18 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Did Noah include termites on the ark?
18 Aug 2017 20:04:31 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, and pi in this case is just pie
18 Aug 2017 20:04:50 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, I can't do symbols on here I don't think
18 Aug 2017 20:04:55 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Light#6734, gr8 m8 would r8 8/8
18 Aug 2017 20:04:59 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, madmike99222#6535, cheers

18 Aug 2017 20:06:33 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, MisterChamp#8562, Lightning is an electric current. Within a thundercloud way up in the sky, many small bits of ice (frozen raindrops) bump into each other as they move around in the air. All of those collisions create an electric charge. After a while, the whole cloud fills up with electrical charges.
18 Aug 2017 20:06:57 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Light#6734, somewhat correct to an extent
18 Aug 2017 20:07:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that is kinda confusing

18 Aug 2017 22:03:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ok, so I thought it might just be a quick thing for me to do and let you fly away with
18 Aug 2017 22:03:35 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, he's to lazy to bug test
18 Aug 2017 22:03:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I don't have the time to do this much...
18 Aug 2017 22:03:51 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, how ben to
18 Aug 2017 22:03:54 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, No work for me
18 Aug 2017 22:03:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Do you want to call it a night and go back to 2.5? lol
18 Aug 2017 22:03:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well
18 Aug 2017 22:04:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I mean we did so much trying to make this work
18 Aug 2017 22:04:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, kinda seems silly to say fuck it
18 Aug 2017 22:04:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I mean, it works
18 Aug 2017 22:04:22 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ben is also a dev 😉
18 Aug 2017 22:04:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's just the plugins which aren't all right
18 Aug 2017 22:04:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I cba to learn a new perm system
18 Aug 2017 22:04:34 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, k
18 Aug 2017 22:04:37 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, just not like ZS
18 Aug 2017 22:04:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well the issue is GP and the islands has built in protection
18 Aug 2017 22:04:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so we are probs fine to delete it
18 Aug 2017 22:05:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Noo, you misunderstand

18 Aug 2017 22:05:11 : LimitlessMc, botchat, Botfuzzy77#2209, 
18 Aug 2017 22:05:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It requires GP for the protections
18 Aug 2017 22:05:17 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, we need a mod to reduce 100% lag
18 Aug 2017 22:05:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, We NEED GP

18 Aug 2017 22:05:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but GP requires the diffrent perms
18 Aug 2017 22:05:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yes?
18 Aug 2017 22:05:35 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, cough cough "Optifine" cough cough
18 Aug 2017 22:05:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yes, it needs luckperms for version 5
18 Aug 2017 22:05:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, right
18 Aug 2017 22:05:48 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, optifine doesnt work 100 percent
18 Aug 2017 22:05:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, so we get that
18 Aug 2017 22:05:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I can do the perms
18 Aug 2017 22:05:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So we can't use pex
18 Aug 2017 22:06:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Well, if you're happy to do allt hat then...
18 Aug 2017 22:06:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yeah I will do it
18 Aug 2017 22:06:12 : PokeIslands, general, Cln2005#2934, better fps doesnt ether

18 Aug 2017 22:18:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Who the fuck uses mongodb or redis for a minecraft plugin
18 Aug 2017 22:18:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Use SQL like literally every other fucking plugin out there
18 Aug 2017 22:18:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Or even fucking... NoSQL
18 Aug 2017 22:18:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, That would've been better!
18 Aug 2017 22:19:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yeah tbh fuck redis

18 Aug 2017 22:19:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So you might have to go without player shops and rely on direct player-to-player trading
18 Aug 2017 22:19:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Which isn't neccessarily terrible
18 Aug 2017 22:20:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Assuming you'll disable PvP
18 Aug 2017 22:20:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that isn't to bad
18 Aug 2017 22:20:19 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, ?
18 Aug 2017 22:20:24 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, What are you talking about?
18 Aug 2017 22:20:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, we could argue it is "hardcore"
18 Aug 2017 22:20:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, pvp shall be disabled yeah
18 Aug 2017 22:20:41 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, ok
18 Aug 2017 22:20:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, no one wants pvp in a skyfactory
18 Aug 2017 22:20:45 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, all chunks are unloaded
18 Aug 2017 22:20:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, hard enough to begin with
18 Aug 2017 22:20:55 : PokeIslands, general, ZS0827#7254, I said it was a chisel? thats why you need to erase that chunk/rollback
18 Aug 2017 22:20:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, with out people killing you
18 Aug 2017 22:21:11 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i unloaded the cunk tough

19 Aug 2017 11:15:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, looks like it yes
19 Aug 2017 11:15:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, How?
19 Aug 2017 11:15:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I had GP plugin installed and it launched sooooo
19 Aug 2017 11:16:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Uh
19 Aug 2017 11:16:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, well part of the issue was that our forge version was diffrent to our spongeforge version
19 Aug 2017 11:16:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, and you know that core plugin that we had but the logs said we hadn't
19 Aug 2017 11:16:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that needed to be in the mod folder not the plugin folder
19 Aug 2017 11:17:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, that seemed to fix it
19 Aug 2017 11:17:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but because perms are set up so you can't do anything atm I don't really know what works and what doesn't
19 Aug 2017 11:17:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, ... that makes no sense
19 Aug 2017 11:17:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I mean I spoke to the dev of the skyblock plugin and 2 other members of their dev team and thats what they said to d
19 Aug 2017 11:18:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ok
19 Aug 2017 11:18:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I think they know their stuff
19 Aug 2017 11:18:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, but yeah it makes no sense to me either
19 Aug 2017 11:18:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, I would have never thought that those where the issues
19 Aug 2017 11:18:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Erm, you did tell them that we had all the mods redirect to plugins?
19 Aug 2017 11:18:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Like, it's literally in the sponge config?
19 Aug 2017 11:18:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, yes
19 Aug 2017 11:18:55 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, How strange
19 Aug 2017 11:18:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, very strange
19 Aug 2017 11:19:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, "it is a wierd of plugin kinda a mod tiein"
19 Aug 2017 11:19:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, was something like the guy said
19 Aug 2017 11:19:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, anyway the server is now up and running
19 Aug 2017 11:19:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, which is what matters
19 Aug 2017 11:20:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, madmike99222#6535, oh also did a bit of research on this lucky perms plugin and it looks like you can you import perms from PEX

19 Aug 2017 12:50:23 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, and i also have source which is like 6-8 if i am correct
19 Aug 2017 12:51:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, this is my babe https://gyazo.com/4df06af9558c94e64b0916f31b301f4b
19 Aug 2017 12:52:00 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, sad it crashed to 66 euros 😭
19 Aug 2017 12:52:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ok the market sort of works
19 Aug 2017 12:53:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, The economy works
19 Aug 2017 12:53:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, The market lists the items and shit, the search is just a bit finicky - working on it
19 Aug 2017 12:59:27 : PokeIslands, general, TheivingCode#9046, hm
19 Aug 2017 12:59:57 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, feel free to log if you want 😉
19 Aug 2017 13:00:10 : PokeIslands, general, TheivingCode#9046, I am on the server
19 Aug 2017 13:00:13 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, i just have to log to see if everything is as it should
19 Aug 2017 13:00:49 : PokeIslands, general, TheivingCode#9046, Btw u dont have to give me my stuff back im good with my new starter because i am trying to be a Fire gym leader
19 Aug 2017 13:01:06 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, :p
19 Aug 2017 13:02:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Ok I get it now, it's not very clean
19 Aug 2017 13:04:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, To search for items, you have to do it the long winded way - so instead of 'axe' you'd type minecraft:wooden_axe or whatever
19 Aug 2017 13:05:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It doesn't work particularly well for modded items
19 Aug 2017 13:05:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, BUT
19 Aug 2017 13:05:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, You can do /market search name Ozikar or something to bring up all items being sold by a player
19 Aug 2017 13:05:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Or you can do /market listings and go through all of them
19 Aug 2017 13:05:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Hell, you can even type 'oz' and it'll still find me
19 Aug 2017 13:09:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, @Mike If you op someone, they can use NEI cheat mode - might come in usefulw hen building spawn
19 Aug 2017 13:09:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So basically the same situation as on IE
19 Aug 2017 13:16:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah, this can work - it's no worse than a chest shop, you'd still be searching manually through shit
19 Aug 2017 13:16:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's quicker this way, even
19 Aug 2017 13:18:43 : The Pack, general, tigertiger02#4338, dam im tired i just tidied 1 of my cuboards which has both my stuff + fam stuff + everyones shit they can;t hold in there room

**cs:go**
19 Aug 2017 14:37:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So I updated the market plugin to the latest version
19 Aug 2017 14:37:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, And now I want to kill myself
19 Aug 2017 14:37:48 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, @KiritoSanPlays it keeps kicking me with errors
19 Aug 2017 14:37:48 : PokeIslands, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, KiritoSanPlays is afk for reason:
**cs:go**
19 Aug 2017 14:37:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Because the solution was to put the thing in to 'mods' instead of 'plugins'
19 Aug 2017 14:38:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So now i'm thinking we should try putting all our plugins in to mods instead, because that might be the cause of a lot of the errors...
19 Aug 2017 14:38:33 : PokeIslands, general, dragonbro0803#0985, @KiritoSanPlays KIRITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

19 Aug 2017 14:50:20 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So a quick tutorial on the market
19 Aug 2017 14:50:23 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, 
19 Aug 2017 14:50:37 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, ./market listings brings up a big list of all the active market listings
19 Aug 2017 14:50:51 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, 
19 Aug 2017 14:51:09 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, ok i here
19 Aug 2017 14:51:09 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Click '[Info]' and it'll bring up more info, you can then press '[QuickBuy]' to buy
19 Aug 2017 14:51:46 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, If you want to search for a specific item, you can type _/market search item minecraft:torch_ or whatever it is you want
19 Aug 2017 14:52:33 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's a bit finnicky, as it's sensitive to misspellings, it doesn't let you just type 'torch'
19 Aug 2017 14:52:57 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, The bright side is, you can also do **/market search name Oz or Ozikar** or whatever, and it'll bring up a single player's listings
19 Aug 2017 14:54:05 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, And then everything else is self explanatory, you can type **/market** to bring up all the commands
19 Aug 2017 14:54:42 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's pretty nice to use once you get in to it - and especially useful on skyblock where it's not practical to have a mall
19 Aug 2017 14:55:46 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, cool
19 Aug 2017 14:55:59 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, installing SF3 now
19 Aug 2017 14:56:12 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, was a server restart done so new island or is my old one still there?
19 Aug 2017 14:58:05 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, New islands
19 Aug 2017 14:58:17 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Though you can't play right now, because you won't have any perms
19 Aug 2017 14:58:30 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, ok
19 Aug 2017 14:58:34 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Unless Mike wants to bless you
19 Aug 2017 14:58:44 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, he probably already has
19 Aug 2017 14:58:56 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, i having problems getting SF3 to take install at min
19 Aug 2017 14:59:08 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, getting error that cant child when installing mods
19 Aug 2017 15:00:18 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, anything else need to know OZ about the new set up?
19 Aug 2017 15:00:36 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, It's very likely buggy
19 Aug 2017 15:00:43 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, understandable
19 Aug 2017 15:00:46 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, But it's ok guys, it's *alpha*
19 Aug 2017 15:00:54 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, yea
19 Aug 2017 15:01:03 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, is pvp bloicked or enabled or claimed land
19 Aug 2017 15:01:11 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, None of the configs have been done yet
19 Aug 2017 15:01:14 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, So that's TBD
19 Aug 2017 15:01:29 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, I think we're going PVE though
19 Aug 2017 15:01:33 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, no worries  i know me and mike were discussing options a few datys back
19 Aug 2017 15:01:52 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, ah thought he mayu have gone with the PVP idea but hey is what it is
19 Aug 2017 15:02:19 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, How is that meant to work on skyblock?
19 Aug 2017 15:02:49 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, at time we were saying all one world for islands then allow pvp through bridging etc
19 Aug 2017 15:02:55 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, or tnt cannons
19 Aug 2017 15:03:34 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, with some kind of claim or protection for those not wanting to engage
19 Aug 2017 15:03:53 : LimitlessMc, botchat, t0mm1x#9209, ;train
19 Aug 2017 15:03:54 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, we were just spit balling ideas at the time

19 Aug 2017 15:05:12 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Briding isn't possible, I don't think... the islands are fairly wide apart
19 Aug 2017 15:05:28 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, And you can't selectively disable PvP/Damage, this isn't factions
19 Aug 2017 15:06:00 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, hmmmm ok no worries like said we were just spit balling ideas for ways to make it SF without being the same as other servers 😃
19 Aug 2017 15:06:33 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Just make an attractive spawn and keep the uptime high, that's pretty much all you need these days
19 Aug 2017 15:06:53 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, true
19 Aug 2017 15:06:54 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, Ozicarus#8421, Also ranking systems, people like those for some reason
19 Aug 2017 15:07:10 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, what error is it giving u
19 Aug 2017 15:07:11 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, yea i noticed that
19 Aug 2017 15:07:25 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, @Dekufuzzy77
19 Aug 2017 15:08:00 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, Ego i guess... ppl like to say they are the best

19 Aug 2017 15:08:45 : PokeIslands, general, KiritoSanPlays#2208, nothing i can do about it

19 Aug 2017 15:09:21 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, darthgremlin1701#1407, without breaking the server etc
19 Aug 2017 15:10:15 : Proton Gaming Network, skyfactory, MisterChamp#8562, Yeah
