13 Jun 2017 22:47:34 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, not realy playing
13 Jun 2017 22:47:50 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Well, score is based off of your total accumulated XP
13 Jun 2017 22:48:06 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so yes, just doing ;train will bring up your rank
13 Jun 2017 22:48:15 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but not nearly as fast as actually playing will
13 Jun 2017 22:48:18 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, lel ;gamble work too
13 Jun 2017 22:48:32 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, anything that gives XP will xD
13 Jun 2017 22:48:49 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, its basically just a better comparison to ;level

13 Jun 2017 22:49:11 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause if you look at our levels
13 Jun 2017 22:49:15 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, you are "higher"
13 Jun 2017 22:49:36 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, you have done prestige i know
13 Jun 2017 22:49:40 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so I developed *Score* to actually dermine higher players
13 Jun 2017 22:50:08 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but its not so simple as saying that a Prestige 1 person is better than everyone who is Prestige 0 xD
13 Jun 2017 22:50:26 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause like is a Lv. 100 Prestige 0, bettor or worse than a level 10 Prestige 1
13 Jun 2017 22:50:26 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, how if it based only on xp
13 Jun 2017 22:50:39 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, It calculates how much XP your prestiges are worth
13 Jun 2017 22:50:48 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, likely lvl 100 better
13 Jun 2017 22:51:02 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but at what point is it better xD
13 Jun 2017 22:51:10 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, like what about Level 50 Prestige 1
13 Jun 2017 22:51:26 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, not the same now
13 Jun 2017 22:52:05 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, depend of witch lvlv he does prestige
13 Jun 2017 22:52:11 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, The point is, ranking uses how much XP you have gained through out the entire game so far
13 Jun 2017 22:52:14 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, not true anymore 😛
13 Jun 2017 22:52:22 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it doesnt matter what lv you prestige
13 Jun 2017 22:52:26 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, it takes XP not levles from you

13 Jun 2017 22:52:49 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, So prestiging at Level 90 Prestige 0, would bring you to like Level 87 Prestige 1
13 Jun 2017 22:53:04 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but at level 50 Prestige 1, you would be at Lv 5 Prestive 1
13 Jun 2017 22:53:07 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, prestige *
13 Jun 2017 22:53:35 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, ah ok
13 Jun 2017 22:54:00 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, better do prestige at high lvl
13 Jun 2017 22:54:13 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, get more xp that way
13 Jun 2017 22:54:27 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, yeah, in a way, it is better to save up and prestige later
13 Jun 2017 22:54:35 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but its easier to level up the more you prestige
13 Jun 2017 22:54:39 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, so its a balance
13 Jun 2017 22:55:15 : Team Frigid, general, Fiodor#5640, ranking use xp  so i the lvl give more xp...
13 Jun 2017 22:55:59 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, but it also weighs Prestiges more than times you prestige the bigger boost
13 Jun 2017 22:56:26 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, So even tho Prestige 1 Level 5 is the same amount of XP as Prestige 0 level 50
13 Jun 2017 22:56:32 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, Prestige 1's score is higher
13 Jun 2017 22:56:48 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, cause it has a 5% boost to XP to XP stored in prestiges
13 Jun 2017 22:57:06 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, anyways
13 Jun 2017 22:57:08 : Team Frigid, general, Wertfuzzy77#0274, ;afk dinner

15 Jun 2017 18:40:28 : Third Reich, general, jjtwilefc#7374, @Himmler could you please expand on why iong being salty is resulting in the retrieval of his gear from me via a third person
15 Jun 2017 18:41:21 : Third Reich, general, madmike99222#6535, my understanding was you were offering his gear back....
15 Jun 2017 18:42:06 : Third Reich, general, madmike99222#6535, if you were not please tell me
15 Jun 2017 18:42:44 : Third Reich, general, jjtwilefc#7374, I'm not, but I don't see either party benefiting from following it up
15 Jun 2017 18:42:54 : Third Reich, general, jjtwilefc#7374, So I guess just leave it?
15 Jun 2017 18:43:07 : Third Reich, general, jjtwilefc#7374, Also I keep getting timed out

15 Jun 2017 18:43:46 : Third Reich, general, madmike99222#6535, if you did not want him to get the gear back then say so....
15 Jun 2017 18:44:15 : Third Reich, general, shuck#1142, doesnt matter now
15 Jun 2017 18:44:19 : Third Reich, general, jjtwilefc#7374, It is to late now he already has it back

15 Jun 2017 22:01:51 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Nekupe#5929, Hmm... if that is the issue then you have to soft restart your game, I think it's an issue with moving pokemon too fast for the code to catch up
