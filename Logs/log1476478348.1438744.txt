https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=158640018045272065&scope=bot&permissions=3173376

A short explenation of why I want the permissions I request.
 - Manage Messages: This is used for the !clean feature. If you don't give it to me, you won't be able to use that feature.
 - Manage Channels: I use this for the !tempchan command so individual people can have their temporary channels (and they get automatically removed).

15 Oct 2016 03:22:15 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Hows the obvious slow death of this server?
15 Oct 2016 03:22:33 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I hope it's still slow, or hell maybe it's getting better again.
15 Oct 2016 03:23:14 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I don't know for sure, but thet numbers seem drastically lower than before
15 Oct 2016 03:28:31 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Anys @Lightning I see you've made staff in such a short time

15 Oct 2016 03:29:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Do you know what happened? Like what caused everyone to slowly bounce, or am I just going crazy
15 Oct 2016 03:29:48 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, we were removed from the server list
15 Oct 2016 03:29:50 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, I haven't been able to focus but most of the numbers are see range from like 40-60 vs 60-100
15 Oct 2016 03:30:07 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, slowly gaining players back though
15 Oct 2016 03:30:24 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, And I guess thats because everyone here is a raunchy asshole?
15 Oct 2016 03:30:28 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Not family friendly enough?
15 Oct 2016 03:30:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, not sure
15 Oct 2016 03:31:09 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, but we're getting more new players so on the rise again
15 Oct 2016 03:31:29 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Also it's the most I've seen jay talk in the discord chat.
15 Oct 2016 03:31:36 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Then again I am relatively new.
15 Oct 2016 03:31:40 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, divach#5559, i'd be going back on the server and bringing people, but i can't run pixelmon anymore.

15 Oct 2016 03:32:53 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, 100 for each voting website you go to?
15 Oct 2016 03:32:55 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, divach#5559, are we still able to buy legends and shinies with real money?
15 Oct 2016 03:33:08 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, only one site enabled right now for voting
15 Oct 2016 03:33:20 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, Lightning#6734, and the donations haven't changed
15 Oct 2016 03:33:43 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, divach#5559, thought the eula would make it go
15 Oct 2016 03:33:46 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, Well when Jay has more enabled voting sites then we can finally talk about an economy growing again.
15 Oct 2016 03:34:06 : LimitlessMc, mainchat, MoshonT#8152, For now 100 a day is a squirt of piss in a bucket
