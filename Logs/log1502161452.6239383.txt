08 Aug 2017 20:48:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, That's not even all of it, there's a bit more
08 Aug 2017 20:48:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Basically just back and forth pretend DDOSing

08 Aug 2017 20:48:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Nothing, I just got told by shuck to pull the logs
08 Aug 2017 20:48:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Right

08 Aug 2017 20:49:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, XD
08 Aug 2017 20:49:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I love it when children try to pretend they know what they're talking about
08 Aug 2017 20:49:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, So as I understand this situation jayjay was trusted on darths claim and then griefed everything to hell so I assume that that is why they are are chatting shit to one another
08 Aug 2017 20:49:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, SO
08 Aug 2017 20:49:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, It was actually Aaron that did that
08 Aug 2017 20:49:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, For the record Darth is like 34 😛
08 Aug 2017 20:49:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Who are we hitting here? Because I feel like someone needs to be hit
08 Aug 2017 20:50:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Are you sure about that?
08 Aug 2017 20:50:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Shuck checked the logs and it turned out to be Aaron
08 Aug 2017 20:50:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Because he acts like an insolent little fucker
08 Aug 2017 20:50:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, jjtwilefc#7374, Couldn't find jayjays logs anywhere
08 Aug 2017 20:50:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, I think they all need a punishment
08 Aug 2017 20:50:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I was thinking that
08 Aug 2017 20:50:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Oh okay he didn't tell me that
08 Aug 2017 20:50:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I know what you mean oz, Darth acts like a chils.....
08 Aug 2017 20:51:37 : Legacy Craft, general, Sleeping Quill#1038, Wait Doc went bowling?!
08 Aug 2017 20:51:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Darth messaged a few people saying he was leaving the server
08 Aug 2017 20:52:05 : Legacy Craft, general, tigertiger02#4338, thats bowling i thought it was a random game lol
08 Aug 2017 20:52:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Did he already leave the Disc?
08 Aug 2017 20:52:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Honestly, if you've seen no proof - I would err on the side that he's not 34
08 Aug 2017 20:52:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, But I'm still not sure why those 2 are fighting if there was no griefing
08 Aug 2017 20:52:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Pfft
08 Aug 2017 20:53:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Oz I don't really what age he is tbh, he acts like a child so I treat him as one
08 Aug 2017 20:53:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So what we doing here?
08 Aug 2017 20:53:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Sending creepy messages?
08 Aug 2017 20:53:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Tempban?
08 Aug 2017 20:53:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Idk if a tempban is called for
08 Aug 2017 20:53:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Well what the fuck actually happened is what I want to know
08 Aug 2017 20:53:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Yeah its pretty unclear
08 Aug 2017 20:53:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Basically just shit flinging from what I saw, albeit fairly fiery
08 Aug 2017 20:54:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Mhh
08 Aug 2017 20:54:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, I guess just tell them 'No... don't do that'
08 Aug 2017 20:54:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Yeah but why was there shit flinging is my question
08 Aug 2017 20:54:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, A slap on the wrist
08 Aug 2017 20:54:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, lol

08 Aug 2017 20:55:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It looks like it started as an argument about the rules
08 Aug 2017 20:55:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Darth instigated it
08 Aug 2017 20:56:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Oh
08 Aug 2017 20:56:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Right I see what happened
08 Aug 2017 20:57:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Is it still going on`?
08 Aug 2017 20:57:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, So bear who is a player and darths friend is in hospital so couldn't log on so his claim experied and it thus got griefed then Darth kicked up shit at this guy on the server in chat
08 Aug 2017 20:57:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, No
08 Aug 2017 20:57:08 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Ended hours ago
08 Aug 2017 20:57:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Ahhh
08 Aug 2017 20:57:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Right
08 Aug 2017 20:57:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Well the timer for the claim is there
08 Aug 2017 20:57:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, So we could just post an announcement on the discord to nobody in particular stating that threatening to DDOS people is not allowed etc.
08 Aug 2017 20:57:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Though very clearly aim it at them
08 Aug 2017 20:58:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Yeah
08 Aug 2017 20:58:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, So the long and short of it is that no rules were broken but people were just arguing rather aggressively
08 Aug 2017 20:58:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Yes
08 Aug 2017 20:58:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, And doing the DDOS bollocks
08 Aug 2017 20:58:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Despite not having his IP lol
08 Aug 2017 20:58:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I mean that is clearly and empty threat right
08 Aug 2017 20:59:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Yeah
08 Aug 2017 20:59:06 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Like he just couldn't
08 Aug 2017 20:59:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It went on quite long though
08 Aug 2017 20:59:30 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Clearly it was an empty threat - but he tried to put it across as a real one
08 Aug 2017 20:59:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Exactly
08 Aug 2017 20:59:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, It's not fair to threaten that kind of thing
08 Aug 2017 20:59:52 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Some sort of punishment is called for right?
08 Aug 2017 21:00:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Just put a statement in discord saying that threatening members of the server with attacks digital or physical is unacceptable
08 Aug 2017 21:00:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Announcement should do it, just to show them that we're aware of what happened
08 Aug 2017 21:00:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Ozicarus#8421, Yeah
08 Aug 2017 21:00:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Alrighty
08 Aug 2017 21:00:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, It'll be an other story if he really did DDOS him
08 Aug 2017 21:00:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Yes it would be
08 Aug 2017 21:01:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Fucking kids these days
08 Aug 2017 21:01:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Threatening to DDOS and shit
08 Aug 2017 21:01:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Just like in the good ol' cod days xD

08 Aug 2017 21:04:21 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, SO just a note to everyone that we do keep logs of everything on the server - and we do know what goes on when staff aren't online. It's not okay to threaten other players, and it's definitely not okay to go around scaremongering that you'll DDOS someone - when we both know full well that you barely understand how the internet works.
08 Aug 2017 21:04:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Yeah
08 Aug 2017 21:04:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Long John Silver#8992, Empty threats
08 Aug 2017 21:04:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Lightning#6734, i wonder if he/she understand that's against federal law
08 Aug 2017 21:04:40 : Proton Gaming Network, grandgeneral, Ozicarus#8421, So yeah, TL;DR - be nice to eachother ffs

The only websites that should be used are Curse, CurseForge, Minecraft Forums, and Planet Minecraft.
