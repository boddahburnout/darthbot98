03 Aug 2017 17:43:44 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, I actually don't understand monster.EntityZombie.  Can a mob cause 22% lagg ?
03 Aug 2017 17:44:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Or all entitys of that type actually, not just 1
03 Aug 2017 17:44:19 : Achievement Heaven, general, llchubyll#5945, brb
03 Aug 2017 17:44:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Most likely it is a mob spawned
03 Aug 2017 17:44:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Spawner
03 Aug 2017 17:44:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, What that means is that zombies is 22% of all mobs
03 Aug 2017 17:45:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, I learned last time@that if mobs cause issues, i tp to it but it's only 1 mob or something
03 Aug 2017 17:45:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, So i restarted the server and all was good again
03 Aug 2017 17:45:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Some times It can be
03 Aug 2017 17:45:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, That basically means there are like no mobs loaded
03 Aug 2017 17:52:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Macomplete#2338, Looks like it's fixed now
03 Aug 2017 18:06:20 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, Good good

03 Aug 2017 22:39:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, oh you have no idea
03 Aug 2017 22:39:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like with my brain
03 Aug 2017 22:39:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, its easy-ish to understand
03 Aug 2017 22:39:28 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, the way i learn things
03 Aug 2017 22:39:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I remeber looking around unis with a friend of mine who wants to do that sort of stuff and I just had no clue what any of it meant
03 Aug 2017 22:39:33 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, There is only like a couple of us that know
03 Aug 2017 22:39:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:39:41 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, i didnt at an earlier point
03 Aug 2017 22:39:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but then
03 Aug 2017 22:39:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like i read some stuff
03 Aug 2017 22:39:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, i'm sure you will be fine with it 😛
03 Aug 2017 22:39:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, ***some*** of it makes sense
03 Aug 2017 22:40:03 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, I played on a bungee server for like a year and it was modded all different mod packs
03 Aug 2017 22:40:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:40:13 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, also
03 Aug 2017 22:40:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, it's scary
03 Aug 2017 22:40:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, coding is just kinda like magic to me
03 Aug 2017 22:40:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like ai is something im scared of
03 Aug 2017 22:40:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and yeah it is to most people but i guess some people just have the righjt mind for it
03 Aug 2017 22:40:55 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, GamerKatland#1817, ahh
03 Aug 2017 22:41:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, AI is scary yeah, the whole idea of automation and AI's is scary as hell, I think it was CGP grey who did the youtube video "humans need not apply" which was really interesting on the topic
03 Aug 2017 22:41:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, some people really do, it is like learning a real language like french or spanish but then it gets harder than that
03 Aug 2017 22:41:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:42:02 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like fuck
03 Aug 2017 22:42:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, playing with AI the fuck is that wizardy
03 Aug 2017 22:42:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, the intelligence explosion theory
03 Aug 2017 22:42:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, thats what gets me
03 Aug 2017 22:42:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, do explain
03 Aug 2017 22:42:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, ok
03 Aug 2017 22:42:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, ok
03 Aug 2017 22:42:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, here we go
03 Aug 2017 22:42:24 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, Ik a lot of the bugs that appeared
03 Aug 2017 22:42:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, pherw
03 Aug 2017 22:42:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, **whipes sweat off forehead**
03 Aug 2017 22:42:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, *prepares for a wall of text*
03 Aug 2017 22:42:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, lmao
03 Aug 2017 22:42:39 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, ok
03 Aug 2017 22:42:42 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, so basically
03 Aug 2017 22:42:47 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, a super-intelligent machine
03 Aug 2017 22:42:47 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, I can name off the top of my head 3 of them
03 Aug 2017 22:42:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, would have the capability to self-improve
03 Aug 2017 22:43:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like an kind of
03 Aug 2017 22:43:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, artificial evolution
03 Aug 2017 22:43:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and so
03 Aug 2017 22:43:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, thus
03 Aug 2017 22:43:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, if a machine had this ability
03 Aug 2017 22:43:34 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, since it has 1, the power of the internet and 2 the ability to do things at LITERALLY light speed
03 Aug 2017 22:43:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, it would self improve so fast
03 Aug 2017 22:43:59 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and within days or weeks would have improved itself so much it would have no need for humans
03 Aug 2017 22:44:11 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, so either passively use our resources or take them by force
03 Aug 2017 22:44:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and because we're so dependant on technology
03 Aug 2017 22:44:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like in transformers
03 Aug 2017 22:44:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, it may sound stupid
03 Aug 2017 22:44:57 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but you could put a piece of software on a phone that would allow it to change it's form or even it's own software
03 Aug 2017 22:45:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like that's what AI would do
03 Aug 2017 22:45:07 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, it would find a way to improve it's own software
03 Aug 2017 22:45:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, holy shit we could have real world transformers
03 Aug 2017 22:45:33 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and if it's TRUE artifical intelligence any restrictions you put on it will be easily bypassed in seconds
03 Aug 2017 22:45:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:45:40 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like it's crazy
03 Aug 2017 22:45:46 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, also the fact that 1 machinme
03 Aug 2017 22:45:50 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, could be a singularity
03 Aug 2017 22:46:00 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like
03 Aug 2017 22:46:10 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, the first person to create ai would also be called a god
03 Aug 2017 22:46:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is scary and awesome at the same time, I don't really know how to feal about it really
03 Aug 2017 22:46:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah ik same
03 Aug 2017 22:46:23 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, anyways
03 Aug 2017 22:46:24 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like
03 Aug 2017 22:46:27 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, in context
03 Aug 2017 22:46:30 : Personal Server, mystic-messenger-rp, Zen#5809, I left my computer on all night
03 Aug 2017 22:46:49 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, the only person in the universe or only being capable of creating life at the 'press of a button' is god
03 Aug 2017 22:46:54 : Personal Server, mystic-messenger-rp, Zen#5809, Let me restart it
03 Aug 2017 22:46:58 : Personal Server, mystic-messenger-rp, Zen#5809, 
03 Aug 2017 22:47:09 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, so if you create an ai that is consious
03 Aug 2017 22:47:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, then in technical terms that makes you a god
03 Aug 2017 22:47:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, a literal god
03 Aug 2017 22:47:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is fucking crazh
03 Aug 2017 22:47:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:47:54 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, Who is still to vote on the contest?
03 Aug 2017 22:47:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like despite the machine either killing you first or keeping you as it's `pet` forsay forever
03 Aug 2017 22:48:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, you'd start the end of human history
03 Aug 2017 22:48:31 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is a scary idea, being kept as a pet by a machine you made
03 Aug 2017 22:48:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, or even being kept in control of the machine
03 Aug 2017 22:48:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, I would rather we didn't end human history pls
03 Aug 2017 22:48:56 : Personal Server, general, Zen#5809, it's internet
03 Aug 2017 22:48:58 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah tbh
03 Aug 2017 22:48:58 : Personal Server, general, Zen#5809, not computer
03 Aug 2017 22:49:05 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, idk if you heard about it
03 Aug 2017 22:49:12 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but fb created 2 robots recently
03 Aug 2017 22:49:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, or more accurately
03 Aug 2017 22:49:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, 2 ai softwares
03 Aug 2017 22:49:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and since they thought the same
03 Aug 2017 22:49:29 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, oh the ai's that communicated
03 Aug 2017 22:49:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, they made their own language
03 Aug 2017 22:49:45 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and started communicating in english words but without any context at all
03 Aug 2017 22:49:51 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, only context that made sense to them
03 Aug 2017 22:49:51 : Achievement Heaven, general, The Irish Rebel#3467, ./mangadd
03 Aug 2017 22:49:55 : Achievement Heaven, general, The Irish Rebel#3467, ./manuadd
03 Aug 2017 22:49:56 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, oh I was thinking of somthing diffrent, I didn't hear about this
03 Aug 2017 22:50:01 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yeah
03 Aug 2017 22:50:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, they started communicating in their own manipulated version of English
03 Aug 2017 22:50:14 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is really weird
03 Aug 2017 22:50:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like
03 Aug 2017 22:50:18 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, FUCK
03 Aug 2017 22:50:21 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, did they ever manage to decode it?
03 Aug 2017 22:50:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, no
03 Aug 2017 22:50:27 : Achievement Heaven, general, tigertiger02#4338, Ooo what's that ?
03 Aug 2017 22:50:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, because it was AI
03 Aug 2017 22:50:38 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, so it's a consious thing
03 Aug 2017 22:50:43 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, they were doing it in plain sight
03 Aug 2017 22:50:53 : Achievement Heaven, general, The Irish Rebel#3467, just commands
03 Aug 2017 22:50:53 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but it's in a machine so they couldnt decode it
03 Aug 2017 22:51:03 : Personal Server, general, 707#0862, Play.mcpz.net
03 Aug 2017 22:51:04 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like they thought the ***exact*** same things
03 Aug 2017 22:51:18 : Achievement Heaven, general, tigertiger02#4338, Which do ??? I am intreed
03 Aug 2017 22:51:22 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is really worrying
03 Aug 2017 22:51:26 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like if you had a direct clone of yourself the first thing you'd both resort to when you wakeup is get out of bed
03 Aug 2017 22:51:30 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, hello
03 Aug 2017 22:51:30 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, Botfuzzy77#2209, *From The Other Side*
03 Aug 2017 22:51:37 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, they were basically clones and both had the exact same idea
03 Aug 2017 22:51:41 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, hi
03 Aug 2017 22:51:47 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, olah
03 Aug 2017 22:51:48 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, wow
03 Aug 2017 22:51:48 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, lol
03 Aug 2017 22:51:50 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, Hi
03 Aug 2017 22:51:54 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, hey tiger
03 Aug 2017 22:52:03 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, so they were basically 2 clones that invented a language only they would know
03 Aug 2017 22:52:08 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, Sooo
03 Aug 2017 22:52:16 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, yep
03 Aug 2017 22:52:19 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, that is really cool
03 Aug 2017 22:52:19 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, SOOO lol
03 Aug 2017 22:52:25 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, also scary
03 Aug 2017 22:52:27 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, What u up to
03 Aug 2017 22:52:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, very scary indeed
03 Aug 2017 22:52:36 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, because it's either impossible to decode or we dont have the technology
03 Aug 2017 22:52:43 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, nothing playing on LC
03 Aug 2017 22:52:51 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, tigertiger02#4338, K
03 Aug 2017 22:52:54 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, madmike99222#6535, couldn't they just ask the AI to decode it?
03 Aug 2017 22:53:04 : Achievement Heaven, staff-room, subzero69#9175, what r u doing tiger
03 Aug 2017 22:53:15 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, but what if they say no
03 Aug 2017 22:53:17 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, and then ask why
03 Aug 2017 22:53:32 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, like it was displayed in plain text
03 Aug 2017 22:53:33 : Achievement Heaven, general, GamerKatland#1817, @FuzzyTiger77  Hello, sweety
03 Aug 2017 22:53:33 : Achievement Heaven, general, Botfuzzy77#2209, The girl who waited.
03 Aug 2017 22:53:35 : Proton Gaming Network, staff_infinityevolved, Kai#9982, as in ;le
